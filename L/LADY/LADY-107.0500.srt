1
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:04,788
你想我么 伽尔
Did you miss me, Gal?

2
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:08,258
玛达莲娜 我可是不远万里来看你呢
Madalena, I have traveled 1,000 miles to see you.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,588
我和强盗们战斗
I fought pirates.

4
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,938
数十次差点儿丢了命
I stared death in the face a dozen times,

5
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:13,808
而我克服千难万阻 就为了去找一个女人
and I did all that to be with a woman

6
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,118
那个女人抛弃了我无条件的爱 选择了一个凶暴残忍的男人
who chose a fierce and cruel man over my unconditional love.

7
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:19,668
-所以 -我是想你了 是的
- So... - You crossed my mind, yes.

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,398
那你见了我肿么不高兴
Then why didn't you act happy to see me?

9
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,138
老实说 我不知道什么该有感觉
To be honest, I don't know how to feel.

10
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,558
伊莎贝拉告诉我 是你想我救你
Isabella told me you wanted me to rescue you.

11
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:27,958
你知道我要来了吗
Did you even know I was coming?

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,698
嗯 我今天早些时候知道的 我一听到这消息
Well, I found out earlier today, and as soon as I did,

13
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,728
我就想了一个我们在一起的计划
I made a plan for us to be together.

14
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,868
嗯 好吧 我也有个计划
Yeah, well, I had a plan, as well.

15
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,538
我们住在一个海边小屋里
We were gonna live in a cottage by the sea.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,238
在那儿啪啪啪 种植一片庄园
We were gonna make love, plant a garden...

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,338
生儿育女
Have children.

18
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:43,838
我歌唱你的美丽
I was gonna sing songs of your beauty.

19
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,408
啊 伽尔
Oh, Gal.

20
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:47,288
那听起来可真可怕
That sounds awful.

21
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:49,328
看看四周吧
Look around.

22
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,128
我住在一个城堡里
I live in a castle.

23
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:53,548
你知道我对我自己有了什么认识吗
And you know what I've learned about myself?

24
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:56,348
我真的是追求物质的人
I really like stuff.

25
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,758
我是说 我为什么要放弃这一切
I mean, why would I give all this up

26
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,058
去当一个肥胖的怀孕农妇呢
to get fat and pregnant and grow my own food?

27
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,988
所以 你并不想让我来
So, you didn't want me to come?

28
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,528
我不该相信伊莎贝拉的
I should never have trusted Isabella.

29
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,668
这么娇小的人怎么撒这种弥天大谎呢
How could someone so small tell such a big lie?

30
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,168
好了 这些都不重要了
Well, none of that matters now.

31
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:14,638
我有一个计划 能够让我留下来当王后
I have a plan that will allow me to remain as queen,

32
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:18,608
而你会是受我照顾的
and you will be well taken care of as my...

33
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:19,738
特殊伙伴
Special companion.

34
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:21,578
你是想说当你的小白脸吧
Your boy toy, you mean.

35
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,078
你就是这样看待我的吗 是吧
Is that how you see me? Hmm?

36
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:26,318
那个衣着干净入时 长相粗犷英俊
As some well-groomed, ruggedly handsome,

37
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,348
性格却又特别敏感的玩物
yet oddly delicate-featured plaything?

38
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:30,648
是的
Yeah.

39
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:34,188
玛达莲娜 我得告诉你
Madalena, I've got something to say,

40
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:38,078
而且我真的是跋涉了千山万水来告诉你
and I've come a really, really long way to say it.

41
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:39,358
噢 不
Oh, no.

42
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:41,458
#我想要你 我需要你#
# I want you, I need you #

43
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,068
#你刺痛我心 我为你洒热血#
# You cut me, and I bleed you #

44
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,198
#你是首优美的诗#
# You're like some kind of sonnet #

45
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,998
#我只想读你读到痴#
# All I want to do is read you #

46
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,768
-#我爱你# - 我知道

47
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,808
-#我是说我爱你# - 是的 谢谢

48
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,678
-#我都说我爱你了# - 你确实爱我
- # I said I love you # - You did.

49
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:56,908
#为何你不有所回应#
# And now don't you want to tell me something, too? #

50
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:01,478
#我爱你#
# I love you #

51
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,748
#就像我爱任何人一样爱你#
# As much as someone like me can love anyone #

52
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,188
嗯
Huh?

53
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,358
#我是说 我爱别人关切我们的凝视眼神#
# I mean, I love how we make people stare #

54
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,288
#就像我们是登峰造极的一对#
# We're quite the stunning pair #

55
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,138
#换句话说 你爱我#
# In other words, you love me #

56
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:15,628
#就像我爱任何人一样爱你#
# As much as someone like me can love anyone #

57
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:16,238
好吧
Okay.

58
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:19,098
#我是说 我爱我们的床笫之欢#
# I mean, I love how when we hit the hay #

59
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,598
#那仿若人间天堂#
# It's more than just okay #

60
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,248
是吗
Right?

61
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:24,538
#我只能说是一般般而已#
# I'd absolutely say more like middling to fair #

62
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:25,978
嗯 等等 什么
Yeah. Wait. What?

63
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,178
#与我共舞吧#
# Dance with me #

64
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:31,478
#你看不出我们多么光彩夺目吗#
# Can't you see how freaking gorgeous we look? #

65
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:34,748
#你感受不到我们疯狂的心跳吗#
# Can't you feel the frantic beat of our hearts #

66
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:38,818
#我们身体每个部位都在摩擦摩擦 似魔鬼的步伐#
# As our various parts rub with such delicious friction? #

67
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,388
#那么 这就是你真正...#
# So, that's all you really... #

68
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,458
#与我共舞吧#
# Dance with me #

69
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:46,158
#已然开始 为何停止#

70
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,258
#那么 你所言之事便是真的爱我#

73
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,138
#就像我爱任何人一样爱你#
# As much as someone like me can love anyone #

74
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:02,778
你现在清楚了吧
Does that clear things up for you?

75
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:04,078
不
No.

76
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:05,778
你什么时候学的跳舞
And when did you learn how to dance?

77
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,923
你听见了么 加雷斯
Are you hearing this, Gareth?

78
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:16,133
我自己的老婆想骗我杀了我最喜欢的厨子
My own wife tries to trick me into killing my favorite chef

79
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,003
以拯救她的前男友
so she can save her ex-boyfriend.

80
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:18,973
你确定是她干的
You sure it was her?

81
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,133
美若天仙 纤纤细腰 大大的眼
Pretty girl, tiny waist, big eyes?

82
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,273
必须的 陛下
Definitely, My King.

83
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,703
没人比我更难过了 加雷斯
No one has it as bad as I do, Gareth.

84
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:26,643
- 没人 - 啊啊啊啊啊啊
- No one! - Aaaaaaaah!

85
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,563
嗯 别担心
Uh... Don't worry.

86
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:33,703
为什么我总要忍受别人这样对待我
Why do I continually allow people to treat me this way?

87
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:34,503
噢 拜托了
Oh, come on.

88
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,333
忘了我是个国王 给我点朋友的意见吧
Forget I'm your king and talk to me like your friend.

89
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,373

你表现得像只猪一样
You keep acting like a prat.

91
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,303
你应该更老练一点的
You need to be more of a geezer.

92
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,543
你知道的 我已经劝了你一次又一次
You know, I've tried to tell you time and time again.

93
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,783
可你全当耳旁风了
You don't turn your ear.

94
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,013
啊 加雷斯
Oh, Gareth.

95
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,053
我一个字也听不懂哇
I can't understand a word you say.

96
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,183
那我问问你
Let me ask you this, then.

97
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,083
你喜欢我吗 加雷斯
Do you like me, Gareth?

98
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,093
- 我是说 你懂的 就 作为一个平常人 - 啊啊啊啊啊
- I mean, you know, as a... as a person? - Aaaaaaah!

我得走了
I got to go.

100
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,583
我的王后叫我呢
My queen needs me.

101

-你的王后 -嗯

你们都听见了么 现在是他的王后了
Are you hearing this? Now it's his queen.

103
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:10,783
好的 去吧
Fine. Go ahead.

104
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,553
你也走吧 这个狠心的负心汉
Leave me, too. Be that guy.

105
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,423
滚 滚
Go. Go.

106
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:14,653
嗯 好的
Yeah, okay.

107
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,293
我为什么酱紫
Why am I like this?

108
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,133
为什么我总是一次次被人辜负
Why do I continually allow people to treat me this way?

109
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,533
-陛下 -嗯
- Sire! - Hmm?

110
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,963

梅林的继承者
Merlin's replacement?

116
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,023

我 我偶尔从他那儿买草药
I-I occasionally buy herbs from him.

118
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,363
草药 为什么 为了做饭
Herbs? For what? F-f-for cooking?

119
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:43,563
嗯 为 为了做饭

120
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,633
好的 可以试试咯 我们去见见赞安诺吧
All right, it's worth a shot. Let's go see Xanax.

121
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,203
我应该穿的更休闲风的
I should probably put on something more casual.

122
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,603
褐色那件啦
The brown.

00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:58,113

我以为你已经死了

你是说因为你背叛了我 他们会把我吊死
You mean because you betrayed me, you thought they would hang me?

131
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:17,833
就因为你的背叛
Because you betrayed me?

132
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,003

Oh, trust me, sir,

133
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,473
我他妈就是因为她才会进这儿的

理查德国王说如果我不能把珠宝和你送来
King Richard said if I didn't deliver the jewel and you,

135
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,903
他就会杀了我的父母
he would kill my parents.

136
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:26,543
我试过警告你
I tried to warn you...

137
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,713
那么多歌曲 那么多私语
so many songs, so many asides.

138
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:30,473
重点是 玛达莲娜王后
The point is, Queen Madalena,

139
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,243
你已经得到了珠宝 你也得到了伽尔凡特
you have the jewel and you have Galavant.

140
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,353
-你必须放了我的父母了 -是么

142

-是的 -真的么
- Yes. - Really?

143
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,423
你为什么重复反问我说的每句话
Why are you just repeating everything I say as a question?

144
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,223
我是重复反问你说的每句话吗
Am I just repeating everything you say as a question?

145
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,653
你 听不见么
You... Don't hear it?

146
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:42,993
-我听见了 是的 - 是呀
-I hear it. Yeah. - Yeah.

147
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,903
-你的确是有在重复
- You're sort of doing it a little bit.

148
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,523
我和理查德国王有个交易
- I had a deal with King Richard.

149
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,443
我亲爱的姑娘
My dear girl...

150
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,243
我虽不是理查德国王
I am not King Richard.

151
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:52,973
但我就喜欢杀
But I will enjoy killing the

152
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,753
吃我残羹冷炙的女孩
girl who tried to eat my leftover man mutton.

153
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,893
有木有热觉得很不舒服
Is... Anyone else uncomfortable?

154
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,333
加雷斯
Gareth.

155
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,033
割下她的脸
Cut her face.

156
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,303
折磨剩余的人
Torture the rest.

157
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,713
-伽尔 -什么
- Gala... - Excuse me?

158
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,933
我说折磨他们 有问题吗
I said torture them. Is there a problem?

00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,543
不 一点儿问题也没有
No. There's not a problem.

160
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,873
我喜欢折磨人 我很擅长咧
I like torturing. I'm pretty good at it.

161
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:21,413
我曾经让一个只剩一个头和一根手指的
I once kept a guy alive for a week,

162
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,583
家伙活了一个礼拜呢
and he was just a head and a finger.

163
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,943
但那是国王下的令
But that order came from the king,

164
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,053
我为国王效劳
and I serve My King.

165
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,983
你的国王很虚弱 加雷斯 你知道的
Your king is weak, Gareth. You know this.

166
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,683
他哭得像个婴儿 心软得像个娘们
He cries like a baby, he cares like a woman.

167
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,893
他还喜欢制作剪纸小板凳呢
He makes decoupage footstools as a hobby.

168

他送给我的 让我好让我能坐下
He got me that so I could have a sit down.

170
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,633
你就是一条狗 加雷斯
You're a dog, Gareth.

171
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,993
狗需要一个强大的主人
And a dog needs a strong master.

172
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,963
干掉他们
Now sic'em.

173
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,935

Are we safe?

175
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,635
这里的人看起来有那么一丢丢狡猾
This neighborhood looks a little dodgy.

176
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,945
别担心 陛下 我们没事哒
Don't worry, sire, we'll be fine.

177
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,075
只要 试着不要害怕
Just... Try not to look scared.

178
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,615
你好啊 见到你很高兴
Hello. Nice to see you.

嗯 我们到这来找赞安诺
Uh, we're here to see Xanax.

00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:18,995
他在阁楼上
He's in the attic.

182
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,765
妈妈 那是实验室
Mom! It's a laboratory!

183
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,035
你叫它实验室嘛
Call it a laboratory.

184
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,165

It's an attic.

呼 真的超温馨哒
Hmm. This is... Cozy.

186
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,665
理查德国王 请允许我介绍魔法师赞安诺
King Richard, may I present Xanax The Magician.

187
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,345
实际上 我这魔法师的称呼
Actually, I'm not legally allowed

188
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,355
还没得到业界许可
to call myself a magician anymore

189
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,685
就因为 那件事
'cause of the whole... Thing.

190
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:46,125
别担心
Don't worry.

191
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,105
把我看做是精神向导
Think of me as a spiritual guide.

192
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:50,975
我允许我这样自称的
I'm allowed to... Call myself that.

193
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,445
谁都可以 也没什么意义
Anyone can. It's meaningless.

194
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,685
你看他金光闪闪的小发箍 蛤蟆
Look at his shiny little hat, toad.

他是蛤蟆 他很酷
It's toad. He's cool.

瑞比特
Ribbit.

199
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,785
别问
Don't ask.

200
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,325
他是个蟾蜍
He was a toad.

201
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,895
我施了一个咒
I did a spell...

202
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:12,525
把他变成了类人的东西
turned him into a human-ish... Type thing.

203

Anyway, what can I do for you gents?

206
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,725
嗯 不是什么大事 真的
Well, it's... No big deal, really.

207
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,625
我们只是 在附近
We were just... in the neighborhood,

208
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,495
嗯 我只是纳闷
and, um, I was sort of wondering,

209
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,455
你懂得 为什么我长成了酱紫
you know, why I am the way I am,

210
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,095
他说过你可以帮我
and he mentioned you might be able to help me.

211
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,265
赞安诺什么忙都能帮
Xanax can help anything.

212
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,265
好极了
Wonderful.

213

This is a... Kind of disgusting little workstation, isn't it?

217
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,725
你看那个卫生间 它是个窗户
You see the toilet? It's basically a window.

218
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,765
是 我说的窗户 是指墙上的洞
And by "Window," I mean "Hole"... in the wall.

It works.

如果你真的打破这牢笼
If you really break it down...

244
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:03,845
“我像爱任何人一样爱你”
"I love you as much as someone like me could love anyone"

245
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,045
可以有很多含义

我想 你在一个地牢里
I think you're in a dungeon

252
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,195
想知道那个关你的女人是否爱你
wondering if the woman that put you there loves you.

253
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:21,365
真正的问题是 你为什么还爱她
And the real question is, why do you still love her?

254

我的意思 的确 她很美

我懂你的心 你值得更好的人

你值得一个能提升你 让你变得像个男人的人
You deserve to be with someone who will lift you up as a man,

261
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,745
一个可以和你并肩战斗 而不是对抗你的人
someone who will fight with you, not against you.

262
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:39,785
也许某个小巧而机灵
Maybe someone who's small and cute

263
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,655
本性很难被约束的人
and ethnically hard to pin down.

264
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:45,785
你的意思是
What you're saying is...

265
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,445
你认为她不爱我吗
you don't think she loves me?

266
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,545
我的天啊
Bloody hell.

267
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,915
哦 请不要折磨我 杀了我吧
Oh, please, just stop the torture and kill me already.

268
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:56,995
我还没有开始呢
I haven't started yet.

269
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:57,895
他不是一伙的么
He's not part of it?

270
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,425
所有人都闭嘴
Will everybody just shut up?!

271
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,895
-你想知道什么是真正的折磨吗
- Do you want to know what real torture is?

272
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,955
-不 不用了 谢谢
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

273
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:11,435
想象一生只对某个人忠诚
Imagine being loyal to someone your whole life.

274
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:12,665
我不准备告诉你是谁
I'm not gonna tell you who,

275
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,635
但假想下 我们都称呼他国王
but hypothetically, we'll call him "The king."

276
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,775
他有点像男妓 但我蛮喜欢他
He's a bit of a ponce, but I like him.

277
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:22,905
他和那个屁股像篮子贝壳的女人结婚
Then he gets married to this rump-fed basket cockle,

278
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:25,845
某人 假想下 我们称呼她女王
who, hypothetically, we'll call "The queen."

279
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,945
我们都知道你说的是谁 加雷斯
We all know who you're talking about, Gareth.

280
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,515
但让我神秘一会儿 好吗
But let me be cryptic for a minute, will ya?!

281
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,655
就让我神秘一会儿
Just give me that!

282
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:35,885
接着说 她不像国王
Now, she's not like "The king."

283
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:38,595
但她强壮 我的力量陷入泥潭
But she's strong, and I mire strength.

284
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,615
而且 还有 我已经宣誓保护国王
But, then again, I've sworn an oath to protect the king.

285
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,945
所以我不知道该怎么办
So I don't know what to do.

286
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:46,785
我是说 这才是真正的折磨 不是吗 兄弟们
I mean, that's real torture, isn't it, lads?

287
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,865
欢迎来到理查德的旅行
Welcome to Richard's journey

288
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,995
去发现他为什么是现在的样子
to find out why he is the way he is.

289
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,595
随手可以拿到瓶瓶罐罐的药水
There's bottles of water in easy reach.

请保持水分

00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:07,765
不要接吻
And no kissing.

292
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,405
当然了 等等 什么
Of course. Wait. What?

293
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:11,105
哦 应该不成问题
Oh... Shouldn't be an issue.

294
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,005
但过去发生过这种情况
But it has happened in the past,

295
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,445
所以我定了一个规则 禁止接吻
so I made a blanket rule... no kissing.

296
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,845
唔 好主意
Mm. Good idea.

00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:34,625
#心怀善缘 不要怨气#
# Relax your karma and try not to barf #

302
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:39,135
#周身一切开始天旋地转#
# As the universe starts to spin #

303
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,805
#天灵灵 地灵灵 梦中一切快显灵#
# Hocus-pocus, expealadocious #

304
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:47,045
#抛开顾虑#
# Set your aura free #

305
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:51,975
#通通石化 金杯深饮#
# Petrificus totalis, drink deeply from the chalice #

306
00:12:51,975 --> 00:13:02,785
#急急如律令#
# Tell us what you see-e-e-e-e-e #

307
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:09,565
我看到了一扇门诶
I see a door!

308
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:13,435
噢 我刚才怎么说来着
Oi! What did I say?

309
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:14,905
别闹
No...

310
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,635
从这扇门走进去
Go through it.

311
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,405
竟然自动打开了
It's opening on its own!

312
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:20,345
这就是魔法
That's magic.

313
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,195
这是我父皇驾崩之日
This is the day my father died.

314
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:32,505
#吾王已逝 吾王万岁#
# The king is dead, long live the king #

315
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:36,005
#吾王已逝 吾王万岁#
# The king is dead, long live the king #

316
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:39,605
#子嗣何在 即将登基#
# Where is his son, who'll inherit everything? #

317
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,015
那是你吗 大人 真是帅到没朋友
Is that you, sire? So handsome.

318
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,785
不是 他是我长兄 金斯利
No. It's my much older brother, Kingsley.

319
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,185
-我什么都看不见   -那才是我
- Young Richard: I can't see anything! - That's me.

320
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:49,385
#安静点 孩子#
# Shut up, you #

321
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:50,755
我什么都看不见
I can't see anything!

322
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,185
#安静点#
# Shut up #

323
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:53,155
噢 天呐
Oh, dear.

324
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,695
吃饱了我就不难过啦
I ate my feelings.

325
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,295
面包多着呢
And a lot of bread.

326
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,445
#您的御剑 陛下#
# The sword, Your Highness #

327
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,445
#帝王之剑#
# Here's the royal sword #

328
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,115
我不需要给来的东西
No one gives me anything.

329
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:06,815
#欲掌其位 必佩其剑#
# To be the king, you must receive the sword #

330
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:10,025
我想要的话 我会亲自夺过来
If I want something, I take it.

331
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,655
再说我也不想当什么国王
And I don't want to be any king.

332
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:14,955
噢 可是 金斯利 天降大任于斯
Oh, but, Kingsley, it's your destiny.

333
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,465
我们依据字面之意为你取名金斯利（国王之地）
We literally named you "Kingsley."

334
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,595
这是上天的旨意
God told us to.

335
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,965
不是说为了赶时髦
It's not like we were being trendy.

336
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,305
我的宿命不是坐在这城堡里  母亲
My destiny lies beyond the castle walls, mother.

337
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:25,335
我要四处征战讨伐 斩杀敌人
I'm going to conquer and kill

338
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,835
还要在这片土地上播撒出更多私生子
and spread bastard children throughout the land,

339
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,775
就如野花种子布满大地
like wildflower seeds.

340
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:31,945
总有人能坐上王位主持朝政的
Somebody else can sit on their ass and rule.

341
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,915
#那是何人#
# But who? #

342
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,685
#何人 何人#
- # Who? # - # But who? #

343
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,945
#是谁 那是何人 那是何人#
# Who? # # But who? # # But who? #

344
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,725
迪仔
Dickie?

345
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:44,825
迪仔
"Dickie."

346
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,695
好极了
Brilliant.

347
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:48,855
加雷斯
Gareth.

348
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:50,165
在
Aye.

349
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,725
你即刻起即为禁卫侍从
You shall be the king's guard.

350
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:54,435
我才十岁 但  好吧
I'm only 10, but... All right.

351
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,965
我是加雷斯 我将为你鞠躬尽瘁 忠贞不二 陛下
I'm Gareth, and I'll faithfully serve you, My King.

352
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,875
#御剑 陛下#
# The sword, your highness #

353
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:05,105
#帝王之剑#
# Here's your royal sword #

354
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,325
#欲掌王位  你必#
# To be the king, you mu... #

355
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,795
事实上 我觉得这把剑还是我来拿吧
Actually, I think I will take the sword.

356
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:12,365
祝你好运 迪仔
Good luck... Dickie.

357
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,405
太丢脸了
How humiliating.

358
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,635
就这么走了
That's it.

359
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,475
当时也太丢脸了
It was humiliating.

360
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,975
一切都追溯于这个时刻
Everything comes back to this moment.

361
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,675
我这一辈子的时间
I have spent my entire life

362
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:28,185
都在让人觉得我是备胎
behaving as if I'm everyone's second choice...

363
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:30,385
我父母这么认为 我的子民这么认为 现在我的王后也是如此
my parents', my kingdom's, and now my queen's.

364
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,965
我要夺回我的王位
Let's go take back my kingdom!

365
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,655
那道该死的门在哪
Where's that bloody door?

366
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,825
好吧 我们究竟要怎么回到那里
Well, how the hell are we supposed to get up there?

367
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,165
太神奇了
That was amazing!

368
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,565
多谢你 赞安诺
Thank you, Xanax.

369
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,635
我现在清楚我要做什么了
I now know exactly what I must do.

370
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:47,465
来吧 厨子 到马棚去
Come on, chef! To the horses!

371
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:49,205
现在最好不要骑马
I wouldn't ride just yet.

372
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:51,005
再说了 这是个关于合法的问题
Again, it's a legal thing.

373
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:54,975
曾经有个家伙 骑着他的马穿过集市
A guy once... he took his horse through a farmers market,

374
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,545
然后当时就有人“啊”的惊叫
and there was... "Raaaaaah!"

375
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,945
马蹄乱踏 乱成一片 四下尖叫 所以
The hooves and the crushing and s-screaming, so...

376
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,045
-呃 -等魔法药水的药效慢慢减退吧
- Ugh... - Let the potion wear off.

377
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,915
就一个小时 怎么样
An hour, say?

378
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:03,955
噢 好吧
Oh. Okay.

379
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,175
嘿 既然这样的话
Hey, in that case, you guys

380
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:07,085
你们想看看我小时候的房间么
want to see my room from when I was a kid?

381
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,485
哇
Wow.

382
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:09,925
那 那就去吧
Let's... let's do this.

383
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:10,625
太棒了
Great.

384
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,795
听着 伽尔凡特
Listen, Galavant...

385
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:24,235
我知道之前我的所作所为很过分
I know what I did to you was horrible...

386
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,935
或许比玛达莲娜更过分
probably even worse than what Madalena did to you,

387
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,935
因为至少她还敢当着你的面做出那些事
because at least she had the guts to do it to your face.

388
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,745
我也不想再提起
And I won't say it again,

389
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:31,745
但不告诉你这些我会更难过
but I'm more sorry than you'll ever know.

390
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,475
我只想让你知道 我真的很抱歉
Just so you know... I'm really sorry.

391
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,685
噢 天哪 你现在心情一定很糟糕 你又在说个不停了
Oh, God. You must feel really bad. You're babbling.

392
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,785
你心情不好的时候就会开启话唠模式
You only babble when you feel really bad.

393
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,225
我心情不好的时候才不会话唠
I do not babble when I feel bad.

394
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,355
我不是说这有多么不好
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

395
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,495
说实话 我已经学会去接受了
To be honest, I've rather grown to like it.

396
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,495
不过你确实很话唠 公主
But you do babble, princess.

397
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,765
话唠公主
Princess Isa-babble.

398
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:52,295
话唠公主
"Princess Isa-babble."

399
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:53,775
好吧 等一下
Okay, hang on a sec.

400
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,035
话唠的意思是说一堆废话
Babbling is when someone talks nonsense,

401
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,665
而我从不说废话
and I do not talk nonsense.

402
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:01,135
我是说 有时候 偶尔那么几次 我可能是话有些多
I mean... Sometimes, at times, I guess I do babble,

403
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,345
但那只是因为脑子里的事山路十八弯
but it's only because I have a lot going on in my head and...

404
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,675
算了不说了
oh. Never mind.

405
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,815
听着 你没必要觉得难过
Look, you don't have to feel bad.

406
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,715
他们是你的父母
They're your parents.

407
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:10,845
当你在乎别人时
When you care about somebody...

408
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,485
你愿意为他们奉献一切
You'll do anything for them.

409
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:17,025
爱就是这么神奇
Love is... Strange.

410
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,225
不过有时又让人厌恶
And sometimes kind of gross.

411
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,995
#废话连篇 真是尴尬#
# It's embarrassingly gassy #

412
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:27,195
#只留下肮脏的内衣#
# And it leaves its dirty underwear #

413
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:30,435
#堆满一地#
# In piles around the place #

414
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:33,535
#爱很鲁莽 又有某种气味#
# Love is rude, it has a sort of smell #

415
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:37,275
#或许人们对爱未曾留意#
# And it thinks that you don't notice #

416
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:38,845
#有时脱口而出#
# And it blurts out things #

417
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:43,545
#令你恨之入骨#
# That make you want to smack its stupid face #

418
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,515
#爱 令人尴尬而又令人困惑#
# And it's awkward and confusing #

419
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:49,785
#令你恼羞成怒#
# It annoys you half to death #

420
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,625
#然后又呆呆咧嘴而笑#
# Then it grins that dopey grin #

421
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,725
#令你无法呼吸#
# And you can't catch your breath #

422
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:59,225
#爱很神奇  有时又飘飘乘风起#
# Love is strange and sometimes sort of smug #

423
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,835
#异常专横#
# And it's really, really bossy #

424
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,505
#又会扰乱你的思绪#
# And it messes with your head #

425
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:09,745
#直到你绝望到无以复加#
# Till you're a hopeless basket case #

426
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,075
#还冥顽不灵#
# And it's stubborn #

427
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,075
#十分无礼#
# It's insulting #

428
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,945
#无比可憎#
# It's obnoxious #

429
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,445
#没有比它更糟的#
# It's the worst #

430
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:21,485
#你一直将它拒之门外  然而你却一头载入爱的怀抱#
# You keep pushing it away, and you fall in headfirst #

431
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:25,255
#爱情如此不可思议#
# Love is strange #

432
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:27,425
#还总是一副醉醺醺模样#
# And often pretty drunk #

433
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:30,195
#淡妆浓抹总相宜#
# It looks different without makeup #

434
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:33,935
#与童话故事相去甚远#
# And it's nothing like the fairy tales #

435
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:37,065
#你梦想着爱成长#
# You grow up dreaming of #

436
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,165
#爱很诡异#
# Love is weird #

437
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,175
#爱很愚蠢#
# Love is dumb #

438
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:43,105
#爱很神奇#
# Love is strange #

439
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:53,485
#这就是爱#
# And that's what makes it lo-o-o-o-o-ve #

440
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:55,755
我真是太糊涂了
I've been so blind.

441
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,855
玛达莲娜从来没有爱过我
Madalena never loved me.

442
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,955
当你心有所属  你会在房顶大喊其名
When you love someone, you shout it from the rooftop,

443
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,425
而非在谜语里闪烁其词
not couch it in a riddle.

444
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,245
或是在歌声里
Or in a song.

445
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,645
那就更煽情了
That's more cinematic.

446
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,815
那么时机怎么样
Well, how's that for timing?

447
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,615
就在我即将死去之时
Our stars are finally aligning

448
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,585
我们的命运之星终将并成一行
on the same day I'm going to die.

449
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,325
不
No.

450
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,925
不  你今天不会有事的
No, you're not gonna die today.

451
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,765
今日你也会安然无恙
And you're not gonna die today.

452
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,325
你也死不了
And you're not gonna die today.

453
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,195
你或许早已成了行尸走肉
You might already be dead.

454
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,705
那 接下来你有何打算
Well, what are you going to do?

455
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:29,905
还能有什么打算
What else?

456
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,805
力挽狂澜咯
Save the day.

457
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:36,915
这门就这么一直开着么
Have these been open the whole time?

458
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,485
就没人想过要检查下么
No one thought to check?

459
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,915
不是吧
Really?

460
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,055
完事了吗 对他们上刑了么
Is it done? Did you torture them?

461
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,725
没有
Nah.

462
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,165
但我下了命令
But I gave you an order.

463
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:55,525
我特么才不叼你的狗屁命令
I don't give a rat's ass about your orders.

464
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:58,295
你可以说我是狗 但至少我忠贞不二 亲爱的
I might be a dog, but at least I'm a loyal one, love.

465
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,565
如今 我效忠陛下 我只听从他的旨意
Now, I serve the king, so I only follow his orders.

466
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:06,235
你这么说我真是太高兴了
That is so nice to hear.

467
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:09,845
一直以来你都是我最忠诚的友人 加雷斯
You have always been my most loyal friend, Gareth.

468
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,575
我知道你不喜欢拥抱 不过假如你喜欢的话
I know you're not a hugger, but if you were,

469
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,615
我会给你一个结实的熊抱
I would wrap myself around you

470
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,885
像由爱缝制而成的皮夹克一样紧裹着你（嚓 好基情）
like a leather jacket made of love.

471
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,315
嗯
Mm.

472
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:19,315
赞安诺干的

473
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,685
-绝壁是他 -嗯
- So much Xanax. - Mm.

474
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:21,855
好 有几件事情要交代下
Okay, couple of things.

475
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:25,195
首先 厨子 我快要饿晕了
First, chef, I am so munchy.

476
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,095
你能不能给我来点 比如 一盘美味煎蛋卷
Could you make me, like, a cheesy omelette

477
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,525
要加些火腿肉 炸土豆 上面浇培根油
with some ham chunks, potatoes fried in bacon grease?

478
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:30,965
-我立刻就做 陛下 -好极了
- Right away, sire. - Excellent.

479
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,165
接下来 我们分手吧
Next, I'm breaking up with you.

480
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,565
加雷斯 能不能请你把玛达莲娜护送到地牢里
Gareth, would you please escort Madalena down to the dungeon

481
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:38,205
把她一辈子拷在那
and lock her up forever?

482
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,175
怎么样
Huh?

483
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,375
走吧
Come on.

484
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,015
等等
Wait!

485
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,375
我们的来宾如此特别
It would be rude to imprison your queen

486
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,615
在这个时候囚禁你的王后可就太残忍了
when we have such a special visitor.

487
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,015
什么访客
What visitor?

488
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,255
你到底在说什么
What are you talking about?

489
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,825
好久不见 老弟
Hello, brother.

490
00:20:57,795 --> 00:20:58,795
金斯利
Kingsley?

491
00:20:58,795 --> 00:20:59,855
他在这做什么
What's he doing here?

492
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,125
你在此有何贵干
What are you doing here?

493
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,465
我来此可是来了结你的
I'm here to take your life.

494
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,255
杀了我
My life?

495
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:06,085
剥夺你的帝王生活
Your lifestyle.

496
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,065
你的王国
Your kingdom.

497
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:11,605
如果你阻扰我的话
Of course, if you get in my way,

498
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:15,625
我也不得不了结你的性命
I'll have to take your life, too...

499
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,435
迪仔
Dickie.

500
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:23,445
这下好玩了
This is gonna to be fun.
