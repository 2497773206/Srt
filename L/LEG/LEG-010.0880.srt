for a girl.

7
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:22,794
A girl off the men's tee, Brad.

8
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:23,530
Ignore him, Lucy,

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:25,798
he's just jealous.

10
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,700
Whoa, was anyone complaining
when they set us up with a girl?

11
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,302
Actually, yes. Something about
her killing your mojo.

12
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,070
(laughing) Thanks.

13
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,105
What are you, like 17?

14
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:36,106
Only for another 11 hours or so.

15
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:38,676
This is an early birthday
present from my folks.

16
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:41,011
Want to give it a try?

17
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:46,415
(groans)

18
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,883
Looking a little whipped
today, Ry-boy.

19
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:48,884
(groans) Long night.

20
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,752
Barely got three
hours of sleep.

21
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:51,853
Not me.

22
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,321
Slept like a free man.

23
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:54,522
No kids, no headaches.

24
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:57,258
No ball and chain.

25
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,760
Yeah, no nothing that matters, right?
BRAD: Okay, guys.

26
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,897
Keep the Vanessa stuff
off the course, all right?

27
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,297
Fine by me.

28
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,799
Just hit the ball already.

29
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:09,903
Come on.

30
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:12,005
That's terrible.

31
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,540
(chuckling)

32
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,576
Just when you thought a bad shot
couldn't get any worse.

33
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,743
BRAD:
Oh, he's had worse.

34
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,977
In the water.

35
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:20,711
In the water.

36
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,446
The water.
All right.

37
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:25,250
I should take the drop.
BRAD: What, are you kidding?

38
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,284
Dropping is for...
Girls?

39
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,951
Sissies.

40
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,486
I was gonna say sissies.

41
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:33,556
Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,457
Ooh...

43
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,026
that is nasty.

44
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:38,493
BRAD:
Just hit it.

45
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:43,430
BRAD: Staring at it's not going
to improve the line, Ryan.

46
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,765
(chuckling)

47
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,567
(cries out in pain)

48
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:47,801

00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,441

51
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,410
Ryan! Grab my hand!

52
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,447
Ryan!
Grab my hand!

53
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,350
Grab my hand!

54
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,851

00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,187
Ryan!

(grunts)

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,657
Elroy, hit him!

58
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,025
Grab my hand!

59
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,929

Tonight?

Oh, my pneumo
from a couple weeks ago.

78

He wanted to thank me.

Oh, I love The Black Eyed Peas.

Where did you score those?

81
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,217
They're Eva's.

82
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,185
She was just about
to invite me along.

83
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,686
Huh.
And why would she

84
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,319
take you when she could take me?

85
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,820

Peas in Boston two years ago.

86

food poisoning.

Gator victim's on our doorstep.

91
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,031
I will pick up
your dry cleaning for a month.

92
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,165
No, no, no,
I will wash your car

93
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,566

94
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,801

GRACEFFA:
Ryan Whitten.

97
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,209
28-year-old male.

98
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,011
Right foot amputation
and lacerated femoral artery.

99
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,745
Abdominal trauma,
altered mental status

100
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:13,046
and respiratory distress.

101
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:17,483
GCS is 4-6-4,
tachy and hypotensive.

102
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:20,985
I was standing there
and then my foot was just gone.

103
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,619
We'll get you
stabilized first, Ryan,

104
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,754
then we'll deal with the foot.

105
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,689
Did they recover it?

106
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,657
WARREN:
The foot!

107
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,959
Haven't found it on scene.

108
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,761
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
BRAD: Hey.

109
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,429
Uh, we're Ryan's friends.
Brad Dalton.

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,764
Elroy Hindley. We were-we were with him.
The gator--

111
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:39,266
had to weigh, like, 500 pounds.

112
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,533
Yeah, he dragged him in the pond
and held him under.

113
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,534
How long was he underwater?
Two, three minutes.

114
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:43,901
Wasn't breathing
when we pulled him out.

115
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:46,137
Why don't you tell everything
to one of our nurses.

116
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:47,471
Yeah, and then do not pass go,
do not collect $200,

117
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,773
you're gonna
go straight to the ER,

118
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,140
get these injuries checked.

119
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,508
What, this isn't the ER?

120
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,577
No, this is MT1.

121
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:54,577
It's trauma only.

122
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:55,611
ER's around the corner.

123
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,912
We're gonna stay with Ryan.

124
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,881
No, no, no, no, you're gonna
go through those doors,

125
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,449
around the corner
and to your right.

126
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,483
Just...

127
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,784
Do not make me continue

128
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,786
with the monopoly
references, Brad.

129
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:07,355
We'll be right back.
Great.

130
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,060
Lucy Reyes, multiple lacs

131
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,228
to head and arms
with blunt head trauma.

132
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,863
All right, Lucy, can you tell me
where you're feeling any pain?

133
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,898
My head.
Everything's spinning.

134
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,098
Let's finish a primary survey,

135
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,233
get her a head CT.

136
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,601
Oh, and, uh...
Next of kin?

137
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:26,869
Her parents.

138
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,237
Got a cell phone number
for her father.

139
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,106
Good work, Kleebus.

140
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,577
(Ryan groaning)

141
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,746
Ow, my leg!

142
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,448
It's throbbing.
(groans)

143
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,182
One milligram of Dilaudid.

144
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,383
We're gonna give you something

145
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,451
to take the pain away, Ryan.

146
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,686
You just drift off
to sleep, okay?

147
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,688
I'll take the femoral artery.

148
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,922
ZAMBRANO:
Check his lungs.

149
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:55,324
I need some help--
he's bleeding out.

150
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,825
Grab me a stack of four by fours

151
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,826
and two units
on the rapid infuser.

152
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,360
(monitor beeping rapidly,
Zambrano groans)

153
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,928
Pressure's still dropping.

154
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,162
Should I call up to O.R.?
He's not gonna make it

155
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:07,830
unless we stop the bleeding.

156
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,231
They found the foot; golf course
security's bringing it in.

157
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,465
PROCTOR:
Excellent!

158
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,532
We'll stop the hemorrhage.

159
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,967
Serena, go and get
that foot ice.

160
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,003
Where is it?

161
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,006
Here's your perp.

162
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,674
Complete with
the stolen goods inside.

163
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,841
You mean the foot...

164
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,809
is inside there?

165
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,543
Mm-hmm. Oh, we dredged the pond.

166
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,411
There was only one gator, so...

167
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,146
So you shot it?

168
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:36,048
You'd prefer him alive?

169
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:41,020
Okay...

170
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,722
Let's get the gator
on a gurney.

171
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,959
Ali Gator, age and sex unknown.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,134
GSW to the right flank,
possible esophageal reflux

173
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,737
from ingesting a human foot.

174
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:06,407
Tell Eva to page us when Ryan,
our foot amputee, is stabilized.

175
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,314
Want me to...
And miss the

176
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,282
chance of a lifetime,
are you kidding?

177
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:21,553
There's quite a bit of

178
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:24,255
tough abdominal muscle
to get through here.

179
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:29,559
What's this...

180
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,163
Must've been midday snack.

181
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,132
Lucky for Ryan.

182
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:42,637
Force of their bite is
2,000 pounds per square inch.

183
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,505
Great.

184
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,974
This feels like bone.

185
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,508
(grunting)

186
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,614
I'll find Zambrano,
if you, uh...

187
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,149
Contact the on-call
vascular surgeon for a consult.

188
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,317
If it's viable, we're gonna

189
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,219
have to act fast.

190
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:07,089
Thank you.

191
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,892
Hey, there, Lucy.

192
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,528
Sweetheart?

193
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,963
Dad.

194
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,998
Mom's trying to get
a flight back from Chicago.

195
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,999
Okay.

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,099
I'm just gonna ask you a few

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
questions and then you can
get some more rest.

198
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,135
You still feeling dizzy?

199
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,104
Um, no, I'm just really tired.

200
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,706
That's normal with head trauma.

201
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,574
How about any nausea

202
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,876
or blurry vision?

203
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,111
No, not really.

204
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:38,146
Well, her head CT shows
no bleeding in her brain, so...

205
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:39,313
Thank God.
Yeah.

206
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:41,249
How soon can I practice again?

207
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,417
You take it easy-- let's...
let's get you checked out

208
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:45,851
before you start
setting tee times.

209
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,053
She has a golf scholarship.

210
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,387
A full ride to Stanford.

211
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,056
Really?
Yeah.

212
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:54,927
Pre-season training
starts in, like, a month, so...

213
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,461
Oh, yeah?

214
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,296
Have you tried opening up your grip?
Mmm.

215
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,098
If you just, uh, don't wrap
your right thumb over your left

216
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,533
so much, then...
Was, um,

217
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,735
was this redness here
before you got those cuts?

218
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:08,371
Um... I guess so.

219
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:11,375
I have pretty sensitive skin.

220
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,109
It could be that
new sunblock, Luce.

221
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,278
Let's get them checked out
just to be sure.

222
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,419
Uh, let's get a tissue sample,
send it up to the lab.

223
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,519
That's it.

224
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,987
I'll come back
once we get the results.

225
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:24,055
Great.
Thank you.

226
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,058
Uh, open up my grip?

227
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,394
Got it.

228
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:36,198
Pressure cf stopped the bleed
in Ryan's leg.

229
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,966
His femoral artery should hold
up until we get him to the O.R.

230
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,267
How is his breathing?

231
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,768
High-flow oxygen
seems to be helping.

232
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,236
Doesn't appear to have

233
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:43,870
aspirated water.
That's unusual,

234
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,738
considering he was underwater
for three minutes.

235
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,705
Ryan's wife just arrived.

236
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:50,140
And wee got an O.R. scheduled
for an hour from now.

237
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,441
Vascular consult's on the way.

238
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:54,144
All right,
let's Ryan a chest CT

239
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,646
to check for any delayed
lung swelling.

240
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,981
Run another set of blood work

241
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,482
and prep him
for the foot replant.

242
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,985
WARREN:
I'll take the Fe.

243
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:02,753
Not if you want to see
The Black Eyed Peas.

244
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:05,722
How about I do all the blood
work, oversee O.R. prep,

245
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,824
and buy all the food, drinks and
souvenirs your heart desires?

246
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,992
Better.

247
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,393
I'll take the wife.

248
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,666
Are you Ryan's wife?

249
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,602
Yes, Vanessa Whitten.

250
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:24,372
Hi, I'm-I'm Dr. Zambrano.

251
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,275
I'm afraid your husband's
in critical condition.

252
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,410
He was having
difficulty breathing.

253
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,245
But it seems to be
resolving now.

254
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,514
I can't believe
this is happening.

255
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:37,316
The good news is that
we were able to stem

256
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,350
the bleeding
in his femoral artery.

257
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:39,685
And how about his foot?

258
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,253
They recovered it.

259
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,720
We're just checking
to see if it's viable

260
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,488
for reattachment surgery.
ELROY: So that's good, right?

261
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:48,625
It's better than
the alternative, yes.

262
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:50,659
Aren't you supposed
to be in the ER?

263
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,995
Oh, dude, I told you the hot
doctor was gonna be pissed

264
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:55,432
if we hung around.
I'm fine.

265
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,699
He won't go, Doc--
he doesn't think I could

266
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,568
handle this.
I'm sting, Vanessa.

267
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,736
Hey, who wants to get a coffee?
Maybe a latte?

268
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,639
You and your stupid golf game.
What does this have to do with golf?

269
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,240
He even took an earlier
flight for you, Elroy.

270
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,508
Yeah, he got bit by an alligator

271
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,809
because he took an earlier flight.

272
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,044
That makes a lot of sense.
You know what, not everyone

273
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,345
can live like they're
still in college, Elroy!

274
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:12,714
Do you think I wanted him to end up here?!
BRAD: Hey!

275
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,748
I'm his best friend!
Yeah, you know what,

276
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,949
I'm his wife! Elroy!
Okay, okay!

277
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,586
Tensions are high.

278
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:22,422
I need you two to calm down.

279
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,324
For Ryan.

280
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,826
He has complicated surgeries
ahead of him.

281
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:30,662
Elroy and I are absolutely
gonna go get that drink now.

282
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,831
Okay. (whispers):
It's gonna be decaf.

283
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:37,234
I'll come find you
if I have any updates, okay?

284
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:43,107
Alligator made a clean cut
through the major vessels.

285
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,342
The foot looks remarkably good.

286
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,476
Especially considering
they pack about

287
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,144
2,000 pounds of bite force.

288
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:52,314
You're a closet herpetologist?

289
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,249
I got it from Proctor.
Mmm.

290
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,485
Quite a mind on that one.

291
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,223
Is Vascular here yet?

292
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,925
Dr. Sable.

293
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,826
You're not Vascular.

294
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,460
You're Cardio.

295
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,660
Actual, I'm both.

296
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,328
No one's both, not anymore.

297
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,497
Cal Berkeley and U Penn
may disagree.

298
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,068
Is the foot viable?

299
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,371
I'd say we have a good shot
at replantation.

300
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,872
How's the patient?

301
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,540
I tied off his femoral artery.

302
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,643
Though not perhaps
with the elegance

303
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:29,245
of someone of your expertise...

304
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:33,015
Oh, I'm sure you make up
for it in other ways.

305
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:42,990
Should I go do... something?

306
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:45,959
Get the foot prepped
and take Ito the O.R.

307
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:55,366
Dinner, Nobu, one hour
after your shift ends.

308
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,568
What if it's 8:00
in the morning?

309
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,369
Breakfast at the Brick House.

310
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,404
And if it turns
into lunch, Tony's

311
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,672
on Palmdale Drive.

312
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:03,873
You think of everything.

313
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:04,974
Yes, I do.

314
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:11,312
(pager beeping) Doctor Deleo.

315
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,914
See you in the O.R.

316
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:18,050
Looking forward to it.

317
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,426
What's up?

318
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,427
(sighing) My golfer,

319
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:34,065
Lucy Reyes, she has a redness
spreading up her arm.

320
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,767
Thought it was
cellulitis but...

321
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,503
PROCTOR: Doesn't appear
to be simple cellulitis.

322
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:44,240
Looks more like a
vibrio infection.

323
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,310
And it looks like it's
spreading to her deep tissue.

324
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,513
That's necrotizing fascinitis.

325
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,915
Flesh-eating bacteria.

326
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,650
If she got this in the pond,

327
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,218
that means the other patients
are at risk, too.

328
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,561
(siren wailing)

329
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,331
Okay, turn over.

330
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,099
What's that for?

331
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,166
To help us track
the rate of bacterial growth.

332
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,300
LUCY:
So, it's getting worse?

333
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,602
It's developed into
something called,

334
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,804
uh, necrotizing fasciitis.

335
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:28,138
I saw that on the news.

336
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,973
That's flesh-eating bacteria?

337
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,274
Oh, my God, flesh-eating?

338
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,676
It's not-it's not

339
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,144
literally eating, Lucy,

340
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,646
but it is causing
the destruction

341
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,515
of the underlying
tissues in your arm.

342
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:39,783
Do the others have it?
Not so far.

343
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:43,220
Not everybody who's exposed
to it gets infected.

344
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,554
What do we do?

345
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:46,156
First we try debriding.

346
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,789
Cutting away
the infected tissue.

347
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,156
But the chance of that actually
stopping the spreading of it

348
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,625
are about 20 percent.

349
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,726
And if it keeps spreading?

350
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,628
If it gets into her blood,

351
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,029
then it could cause
something known as sepsis.

352
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,798
Um, now, once that happens,

353
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,099
it will shut down
your vital organs.

354
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,669
The only sure way
to completely eliminate

355
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,270
the bacteria...

356
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:11,570
is amputation of the limb.

357
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:13,505
What? No, no.

358
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,006
And that's only

359
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,307
as a last resort, Lucy.

360
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:17,975
You're not cutting off my arm.
Let the doctor

361
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:19,176
speak, sweetie.
No, I don't care

362
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:20,578
what you have to do.
If there's a 20 percent

363
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,711
chance to save it, just...
We're gonna do

364
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,145
whatever we need to do
to get you through this.

365
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,114
That's not your call!
Let's just listen.

366
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:27,416
No, I'm an adult now, okay,

367
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,317
or I will be in, like,
six hours, and this is my body.

368
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:31,151
You can't tell me
what to do with that.

369
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,086
Lucy, Mr. Reyes, I understand.

370
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,154
It's a lot to absorb,
but at the moment,

371
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,255
hard as it may sound,
I just need you to be

372
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:40,759
patient until the biopsy results
come in.

373
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,128
Then we decide how to proceed.

374
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,496
Together.

375
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay?

376
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,375
ZAMBRANO:
Good news, Ryan.

377
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,477
Your chest CT looks no

378
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:52,711
so we're gonna prep you
for the O.R.

379
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,513
My wife, Vanessa?

380
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,647
Here.

381
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:58,182
She's in the waiting area
with your friends.

382
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:01,185
Not to worry. I've been
updating her on your condition.

383
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,119
Can you, uh,
take him up to the ICU

384
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,554
and page me
when the O.R.'s ready?

385
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,755
Great.

386
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,089
I'll see you soon.

387
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:13,194
Clam chowder
or chicken with stars?

388
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:17,731
Oh, first, I have a rule about
taking soup from strangers.

389
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:19,499
Really?
Mm-hmm.

390
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,101
And second, why aren't
you still the ER?

391
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:26,004
Well, yeah, I had to use my
ninja moves to get Elroy there.

392
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,906
But then I claimed
I had to go to the bathroom

393
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,140
so I could go check on Vanessa.

394
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:32,176
Mmm. Those two-- it's
like fire and ice.

395
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:33,811
Yeah, I noticed.

396
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,312
Must be hard
running interference.

397
00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:36,713
We've en tight since college.

398
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,915
Elroy took it
kind of personally

399
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,551
when Vanessa AR.

400
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,920
Started calling her Yoko.

401
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,288
She broke up the Fab Three?

402
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:47,589
Whoa, you mean Fab One.

403
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,224
Those two, they're...
well, they're all right.

404
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,759
Are you flirting with me?

405
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,027
The soup offering
might've been flirting.

406
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,563
But the, uh, the banter,

407
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,364
it's just keeping
the communication open.

408
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,933
In hopes that if something does
happen, you'll come to me first.

409
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:03,369
That way I can manage
fire and ice.

410
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,404
Sounds like a solid plan.

411
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,405
I'll see you in bit.

412
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,907
What about our soup date?

413
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,142
I have lives to save.

414
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,543
Get back to the ER.

415
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,345
Consider it a rain check.

416
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:21,684
I'm going to talk to him, okay?

417
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,551
Hey, Dr. Deleo?

418
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:31,923
If-if there's
any chance...

419
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,925
that you have to amputate

420
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,260
to save her life,

421
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,161
you gotta promise me
that you'll do it.

422
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:41,629
I'm going to do what's best
for your daughter, Mr. Reyes.

423
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,931
Yeah, but after midnight,
she's an adult.

424
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,199
Which means the decision
becomes hers.

425
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,868
Now, I can already see...

426
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,435
Mr. Reyes...
No, it's all gonna be

427
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:52,703
about her golf.

428
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,205
It's-it's the great
love of her life.

429
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:59,675
Legally, things may change
because of the birthday

430
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,411
but emotionally,
she's still just a kid.

431
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,380
She is too young...

432
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:10,386
realize...
that she's mortal.

433
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,291
If this were your daughter...

434
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,232
Lynn...

435
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,601
Lucy Reyes-- do you have
the biopsy results yet?

436
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:25,769
Just got off the
phone th the lab--

437
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,869
they're running behind.

438
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,639
Ok, I need to book
an O.R. before midnight

439
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,874
in case I need to do
an arm amputation.

440
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,308
I'll see what I can do.
No, no, see-see-e isn't gonna work.

441
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,510
Must be fore midnight,
and ll the lab

442
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,745
I needed those results yesterday.

443
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,613
Got it.

444
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:44,215
(beeping)

445
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:48,454
I got six hours to save her arm.

446
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,624
Lunch?

447
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,425
Uh, for the gator.

448
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:56,095
Ryan Whitten's foot--

449
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,930
If the foot's out of the gator,

450
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,132
why am I still looking at that.

451
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,702
Fish and Wildlife
have to come get it.

452
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,771
Make sure it's not tagged
or protected or something.

453
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,639
Well, they better hurry
before Chatty Kathy

454
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,242
makes herself a belt
and a new pair of pumps.

455
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:13,643
(giggling)

456
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,777
Where you headed?

457
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,278
Uh...

458
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,313
Well, Ry's CT was clear,
so I'm gonna update his wife.

459
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,015
(sighs)

460
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,518
're so not making it
to that concert, are we?

461
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,853
At this pot, not likely.

462
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,657
Best show you ever saw?

463
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,592
Hmm, Chili Peppers.

464
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:36,394
Drove all day to see
them in Tallahassee.

465
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:40,464
Daft Punk Lollapaoza.

466
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,767
Grant Park when I was
at the University of Chicago.

467
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:47,037
Head bouncing, hands in t air

468
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:48,305
all sweaty

469
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,973
fr the humidity. What?
Oh, yeah.

470
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:52,441
Hi, Kathy.
Hi, Kathy.

471
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,325
PROCTOR:
I got your page.

472
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,393
I have a problem.

473
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,362
You have my bike.

474
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:17,595
Oh, I figured if
repetitive motion

475
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,663
works for you,
I'm willing to give it a try.

476
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,632
This about the golfer girl?

477
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,268
I have exactly five hours

478
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,270
and 44 minutes
to decide whether or not

479
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,205
to amputate Lucy Reyes' arm.

480
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:29,773
You started debriding?

481
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,608
I don't want to cut
too much tissue

482
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,077
without knowing how deep
the infection's spread

483
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,445
That's all you can do.

484
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,415
Yeah, but Lucy
turns at midnight.

485
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,982
So, up until that point,

486
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,849
the medical decisions
rest with her dad.

487
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,751
But once that clock
strikes 12:00...

488
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,687
It's up to Lucy.

489
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,322
Yeah, and her dad's afraid
she's gonna wait too long

490
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:48,657
to make the call.

491
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,992
So, in the meantime,

492
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,527
I have to figure out
what I can do

493
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:57,731
to save her life, her arm,

494
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,866
and a relationship
with her father.

495
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,600
Give me the bike.

496
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,434
Really?

497
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,169
You want my help,
give me the bi.

498
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,175
I assume you've got her started
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

499
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:16,044
Yeah, from the moment
she was diagnosed.

500
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:18,445
But it doesn't seem
to be slowing the infection.

501
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,747
Any sign of lactic acid

502
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:22,350
Came back normal.

503
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,519
Good.

504
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,687
That points away from sepsis.

505
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:29,557
You should get hold of a
near-infrared spectroscope.

506
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:33,694
Would that work?

507
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,662
I've only heard of them being
used to check brain function

508
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:36,963
through the skull.

509
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,465
Can also measure O2 levels
in deep tissue.

510
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,800
You'll be able to see where
and how much of Lucy's arm

511
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,103
is still getting oxygen,

512
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,771
and how much more tissue
to debride.

513
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,673
That's right.

514
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,808
That's the bike.

515
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,210
(pager beeping)

516
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:57,714
And that's my O.R.
ready for OT reattachment.

517
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:02,017
Hey, thanks.

518
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,286
"Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst."

519
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,955
Smart lady.

520
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,656
She also used to say,

521
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:10,791
"Put things back
where you found them."

522
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,164
Nice work on his femoral artery.

523
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:18,798
I managed to stop the bleeding.

524
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,900
Looks like our dinner's
become breakfast.

525
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:23,969
Foot's ready for replant.

526
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,270
Keep it on ice.

527
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,105
Ryan's artery isn't

528
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,173
supplying blood
to his lower leg.

529
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:30,774
Leaving us nothing
to attach the foot to.

530
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,177
(pager beeping)
It'll merely delay things

531
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:34,911
until we do a bypass procedure.

532
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:36,546
Which, unfortunately,
will have to wait.

533
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:39,215
I have an emergency aortic
transection to attend to.

534
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:41,383
Torn aorta trumps
severed foot every time.

535
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,151
Only for an hour or so.

536
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,485
Now what?

537
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,721
What if the leg's not viable
in an hour or so?

538
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,755
<i>Ever read Frankenstein?</i>

539
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,457
<i>I saw Young Frankenstein.</i>

540
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,991
Close enough.

541
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:55,293
We're gonna need surgical
tubing and vascular loops.

542
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:57,028
I'm not sure I follow you.

543
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,364
We're gonna run blood through
the tube to his lower leg

544
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,866
until Dr. Sable can
do a formal repair.

545
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:04,135
External bypass.

546
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:07,004
That's like "Franken-leg."

547
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:10,006
Franken-sort-of.

548
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:19,181
Vanessa?

549
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:20,583
How's Ryan?

550
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:21,851
He's doing well.

551
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,786
Uh, his chest CT came back clear

552
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,688
and now he's up in the O.R.,
ready for his

553
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:26,889
foot reattachment surgery.

554
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,657
(sighing):
Thank God.

555
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,027
Uh, listen,

556
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:33,262
I wanted to say sorry

557
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:34,864
for the little fight
Elroy and I had.

558
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,733
We've um, never really
seen eye-to-eye.

559
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:40,202
Yeah, I-I got that.

560
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:45,207
Brad's been such a saint,

561
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,978
keeping Elroy
from driving me nuts.

562
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,414
Brad?

563
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:57,317
Mr. Dalton?

564
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,584
Wake up.

565
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,788
What?

566
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:08,090
Can you stand up?

567
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,965
Wait, what's wrong with him?

568
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,833
What is this?
You got a bump back here.

569
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,668
Did he hit his head?

570
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,703
VANESSA: I don't know.
He didn't mention anything.

571
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:25,071
I need a gurney out here!

572
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,710
If I'd have known
there was a bed involved,

573
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:36,147
I would've brought my own
blankie and stuffed animal.

574
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:41,150
I'm gonna take...
I'm gonna take a little nap.

575
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:42,951
No. No, no.

576
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:43,918
You stay with me, Brad.

577
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,253
Okay.
Okay?

578
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,489
How did you end up
with that bump on your head?

579
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,590
(machine whirring)

580
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,391
Gator wrestling.

581
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:53,826
Huh.

582
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:57,729
I showed that thing who's boss.

583
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,934
ZAMBRANO:
Do you remember blacking out?

584
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,168
(over intercom):
Now that you mention it,

585
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,271
I do remember
having a little headache.

586
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:11,274
But it... it was no big deal.

587
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:12,942
ZAMBRANO:
Tough guy, huh?

588
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:16,579
I am tough.

589
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,349
I'm sweet though.

590
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,451
Hey, Doc?

591
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,186
Yeah.

592
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:27,256
Anybody ever propose to you
in this thing?

593
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,128
Uh, happens at least
once a week.

594
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,396
He's starting to herniate
his brain.

595
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:35,298
Call Dr. Chung
in Neurosurge.

596
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,930
I bet we could make it work.

597
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,963
I prob...

598
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:43,996
I probably should
get you a little cup of soup.

599
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:46,265
(monitor beeping rapidly)

600
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,166
Brad?!

601
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,835
Brad? Brad!

602
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,636
Stay with me. Brad!

603
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:54,736
He's posturing.

604
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:57,472
Get me a crash cart
and burr hole kit.

605
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,641
Hurry!

606
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,810
CHUNG:
I managed to evacuate the clog,

607
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:03,713
but there's massive
brain injury.

608
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:07,049
ZAMBRANO:
Come on, Brad, don't give up.

609
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,884
Keep fighting.

610
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:12,387

What, uh...

631

That's a delayed bleed

632
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,508
in the skull
caused by hitting his head.

633
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:25,847

the pressure, but...

634
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:27,848
he didn't make it.

00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:31,218
He died?

637
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:33,421
We got to him too late.

638
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:36,857
I'm sorry.

639
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:38,158
What?

640
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,227
He-he-he was just

641
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:41,862
totally fine.

642
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:44,898
I mean, he didn't complain
of a headache or nothing.

643
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,867
VANESSA:
I can't believe this.

644
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,303
I mean, he was-he was
just standing right here.

645
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:53,538
I'll be back
to check on you both

646
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,541

All right,
we're gonna need a scalpel

654
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,216
and, uh, Lidocaine with epi.

655
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:44,717
LUCY:
Wh-what are you doing?

656
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:47,452
I'm cutting away
some of the infected tissue,

657
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:51,288
try and stop the infection
from spreading.

658
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,756
Hopefully this will

659
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,958
buy us some time
until we can get into an O.R.

660
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,326
Wait, an O.R.?

661
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,728
I can do a full
debridement there

662
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:01,096
and, uh, and I can cut deeper.

663
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,668
You're gonna feel some pressure.

664
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:09,403
I want you to let me know
if you feel any pain.

665
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:14,107
My dad-- has he been
telling you to amputate?

666
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:15,441
Just trying to make sure
we don't let this thing

667
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,443
get into your blood.

668
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:18,778
Yeah, but he's not the one

669
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,447
that has to live with
the decision, I am.

670
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:23,682
I've wanted to be
on the Stanford golf team for...

671
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:25,716
since I was, like,
ten years old.

672
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,451
I just don't understand it.
I should be able

673
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:30,387
to make my own decision, okay?
Lucy...

674
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:33,056
I mean, one hour from now,
on one side of a second,

675
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:36,128
my dad is in charge
and on the other, I am.

676
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:39,838
I mean, what changes
in that one second?

677
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,576
You know, I-I don't know.

678
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:47,377
But we're gonna keep fighting so
we don't ever have to get there.

679
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:49,578
All right?

680
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,942
Yeah.

681
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,111
(sighing)

682
00:29:57,947 --> 00:30:00,081
How are we doing
on Ryan's popliteal artery?

683
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:02,683
Tying off the last
suture right now.

684
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:04,017
Good.

685
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,352
This should restore
circulation to his foot.

686
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,354
Let's give it a try.

687
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:18,595
Blood seems to be flowing.

688
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:20,030
Yeah.

689
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:22,030
And the leg is pinking up.

690
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:25,600
This is amazing.

691
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,635
Like nothing they teach
you in med school.

692
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:29,936
Doesn't seem to be any leakage.

693
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:31,204
That's a nice job.

694
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,672
(bad Austrian accent):
Zame to you, Herr Fronkenshteen.

695
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:34,773
(chuckles)

696
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:35,907
<i>Teri Garr, Young Frankenstein.</i>

697
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:37,342
I prefer the classics.

698
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:38,176
Boris Karloff?

699
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:39,677
<i>The Munsters.</i>

700
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,379
(chuckles)

701
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,581
You can take Ryan to ICU.

702
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:44,149
I'll see if I can
track down Dr. Sable.

703
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:56,159
You did your own bypass.

704
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,860
PROCTOR:
The only asset more valuable

705
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:00,762
in the army than
speed is creativity.

706
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:03,865
Hmm, I like a man
with imagination.

707
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,600
It's not bad.

708
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:08,268
The shunt is crude
but clearly effective.

709
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,070
Are we good for reattachment?

710
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:12,439
I'm all yours.
Excellent.

711
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,574
Of course, I'll
need you to assist.

712
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:17,076
I'd hate to mess with
your shunt without you.

713
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,946
My crude shunt.

714
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,380
No slight.

715
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,449
I was just hoping you
wouldn't proceed without me.

716
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,785
I've been proceeding
without you for my entire life.

717
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:27,620
In fact, if I'd
waited any longer,

718
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:28,888
the chance
of reattaching the foot

719
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,589
would've been made much worse.

720
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,291
Hmm.

721
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,926
You know, I don't think...

722
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:37,496
I don't think
we're gonna make breakfast.

723
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,698
We won't make it out in time?

724
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:42,768
No, it's not that.
It's, um...

725
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:48,340
You're more me than I am,
if that makes sense.

726
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,776
And, uh, as much as
I quite like the idea

727
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,278
of dating myself,
it's a little weird.

728
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,848
So, where does that leave us?

729
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:59,585
You're just gonna have to
wait for me to ask you out.

730
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:08,293
Dr. Deleo, it's
getting late.

731
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,695
I'm aware of that,
Mr. Reyes.

732
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,230
My O.R. time got pushed.
What does that mean?

733
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,766
You promised me.
No, no, no, what I promised you, sir,

734
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,201
is that I would do
everything I could

735
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:18,870
to save your daughter's life.

736
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,739
He's not taking my arm, Dad.

737
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,007
Lucy, I'm sorry

738
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,742
but this is not about
golf or Stanford anymore.

739
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,377
This is your life.
I know that.

740
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,012
Now, you have always
pushed yourself

741
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,647
to be the best at everything,

742
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,950
you are so strong, but
you're not invincible.

743
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:36,285
What are you gonna do?

744
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:38,687
Yeah, what?

745
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,390
I'm taking her to surgery.

746
00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:47,896
Let get her arm on an arm board
and prepped with Betadine.

747
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,167
Hang another bag
of antibiotics.

748
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,145
The room's ready for you,
Doctor.

749
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,183
Dr. Deleo?

750
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:16,885
Everyone just stop.

751
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:22,922
You're running out of time.

752
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:27,325
(alarm beeping)

753
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:28,859
What is that?

754
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,029
Happy Birthday, Lucy.

755
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,564
(sighs)

756
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:38,865
I knew you were on my side.

757
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:44,405
Hey, of course I'm on your side.

758
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:51,318
Which is why I have to tell you

759
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,654
that we need
to amputate your arm.

760
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,567
I thought you'd try to save
my arm no matter what.

761
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,000
I did.

762
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,134
But if we amputate,

763
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,236
you can have a long
and rewarding life.

764
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:14,004
But if we don't,
there's a chance that

765
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:16,572
that infection will
spread, and once it does,

766
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:17,974
you will die.

767
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,142
Why can't you try
the debriding thing first?

768
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,344
I don't care
how much you cut out.

769
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:22,846
Listen, Lucy...
No, I don't get it.

770
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,148
If you thought I should
amputate, why did you wait?

771
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:29,418
Because I wanted this
to be your decision.

772
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,087
Not one you can blame on your
dad for the rest of your life.

773
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:36,356
So it's all up to me now.

774
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:38,091
So,

775
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,692
what'll it be?

776
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:54,068
Heard about your patient, Brad.

777
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:57,471
I'm sorry.

778
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:01,375
He offered me soup.

779
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:03,510
You know why getting

780
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:08,914
The Black Eyed Peas
tickets made me so happy?

781
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:12,016
I just want one night where
the weight of life and death

782
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:15,285
isn't hanging in the balance,
and I'm...

Yeah.
