Roommate NTR ~ The best friend who stayed in the house
together and the wind of his girlfriend Cum video ~

3
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:40,080
What?

4
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,407
Attention?

5
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,583
Yoo-chan, are you serious?

6
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:47,001
Can not I? Conomi-chan

7
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,876
What happened?

8
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:50,569
Explain it one more time.

9
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:51,289
okay

10
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,892
A friend of mine

11
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:57,115
I think I was kicked out of my house.

12
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,064
Until a moving house is decided

13
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:03,104
To stay in our house

14
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:08,049
I really... I was just adapted to living together...

15
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,612
Yeah

16
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:13,876
But I'm really in trouble.

17
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:17,179
Really, it's too nice to ride.
Yu Chan

18
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,269
That's a good thing about Yu-chan

19
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,769
Is he a person I do not know?

20
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,210
Who is it?

21
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,416
Do you want to see pictures?
-Huh

22
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:31,061
He's such a guy.

23
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,888
It's called Kohei.

24
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,035
He's the usual band.

25
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,994
I put the band too high
She said she was cut.

26
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,240
So I can not get my monthly rent.
I think I got kicked out.

27
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,161
I may be the type I hate most.

28
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:53,851
do not say that

29
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,096
He's pretty good.

30
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,397
It seems a little tough...

31
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:01,112
Still pretty

32
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,140
The band is working hard.

33
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,505
It looks light.

34
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:08,493
It's not already in appearance.
- Nevertheless, the band

35
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:12,351
I practice all together.
I often missed Alba

36
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,508
That's it.

37
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:15,980
It looks like it came.

38
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,969
What happened?

39
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,494
Wait a minute

40
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,243
Who came?

41
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,204
Yusuke

42
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,094
Take a moment.

43
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:29,316
Girlfriend?

44
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,987
I'm Kohei.
Please, please.

45
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,564
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,589
What was the consultation a while back?

47
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:53,036
Kohei, now I have no money
I do not think I have a place to stay.

48
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,090
sorry

49
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,821
How long do we have to stay with him?

50
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:04,991
I'll let you out until next month, Konomi's birthday.

51
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,486
please

52
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,168
Really

53
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,493
It's until my birthday.

54
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,110
Promise

55
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:13,203
All right.

56
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,123
It's a promise.
-Huh

Hi, girlfriend

60
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:47,999
Good morning

61
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,337
What about Yusuke?

62
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:54,806
Yu-chan went to Alba.

63
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,278
I work hard.

64
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,886
Cleaning?
-Yeah

65
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,384
I'll help you.

66
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,636
It's okay

67
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:07,875
no

68
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,525
I clean up.

69
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:10,497
Give it to me.

70
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,569
The man is more powerful.

71
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,578
thank you

72
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,263
Look, you're clean.

73
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,082
Really.

74
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:24,872
From Yusuke

75
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,290
I can not clean it.

76
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,667
You should do this.

77
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,516
I wonder if he can do the right thing...

78
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,946
I do not know how many times you changed the shift.

79
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,929
There's no such thing as good.

80
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,959
Iknow, right

81
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,602
Really

82
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,215
Because I'm really sincere.

83
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,165
Yusuke

84
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:51,775
Do you know Alva Leader?

85
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,194
Ok?

86
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:54,433
I did not say.

87
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,739
I did not know

88
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,886
The manager liked it so much.

89
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,017
It's nice to not talk.

90
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:15,637
I've been there.

91
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,350
I've been there.

92
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,050
Come on
- Yusuke, come on.

93
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,905
I was learning guitar from Mr. Kohei now.

94
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,001
like that
-Huh

95
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,622
try

96
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:45,378
It's not.
- It's wrong.

97
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,426
You told me.

98
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:51,062
It's not.

99
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,390
You told me.

100
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,312
It is difficult

101
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,181
On this day,

102
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:13,677
This day, this day

103
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,050
On this day,

104
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,014
This day I went to school

105
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,688
On this day,

106
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:26,026
That's why you can not play at all.

107
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:32,602
Conomi-chan

108
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,246
What are you watching?

109
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:37,126
I'm looking at Yu-chan's alba shift.

110
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,278
I was not that busy before...

111
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,103
Yusuke, I work hard.

112
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:47,427
It's a busy time now.
I can not help it.

113
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,854
Look at it

114
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,928
Let's drink this together.

115
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:53,967
What is this?

116
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,044
alcohol

117
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,440
alcohol?

118
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,028
But

119
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,711
Yu-chan is working hard.

120
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,454
Is it okay to drink?

121
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,769
Do not bother with such details.

122
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,560
Yusuke is sad when I look sad.

123
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,275
Let's drink this and keep it cheerful.

124
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,472
still...

125
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,533
Let's sleep.

126
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,260
Yes, I do.

127
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,172
Thanks

128
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,166
What do you like?

129
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,615
Did you get something?
- Pretty much.

130
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,074
Do you like alcohol?
- Yeah, I like it.

131
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,430
I want to drink something sweet.
- What?

132
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,720
There's a sweet spot here.

133
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,268
Thanks

134
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:34,884
this

135
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,518
good

136
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,869
Do you like this?
-Huh

137
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,696
Can you drink this?
- Yeah. - Thanks.

138
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,106
listen

139
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,420
Yu-chan

140
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,890
When I lived together, I said that I would play a lot.

141
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,876
I just do not get any attention at all.
What do you think?

142
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,514
I can not help it.

143
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,718
Can not you help it?
- Alvar leader.

144
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,314
still

145
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,089
Alba

146
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,672
I'm lonely

147
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:10,163
I know it's lonely.

148
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Konomi-chan, I really like Yusuke.

149
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,464
is it?

150
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,239
Feeling?

151
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,651
Of course not.

152
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,613
It's on the face.

153
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:23,601
is it?

154
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:25,723
Did you drink lightly?

155
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,063
Yes.

156
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:28,943
The face is red

157
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:29,885
It's hot.

158
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,966
Do not you drink with Yusuke?

159
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,852
I do not drink with Yu-chan at all.

160
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,930
I have never seen him.

161
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:39,123
It's just Alba.

162
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,363
I do not have time to spend together

163
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,280
I can not help being busy.

164
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,041
Konomi-chan, what if you get drunk?

165
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:46,963
I?

166
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:47,559
Huh

167
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:48,877
When you take

168
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,170
a little

169
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,405
Brighten

170
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,518
Is it a little bright?

171
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:57,934
Yes, a little

172
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:58,871
a little?
Huh

173
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,119
So if you drink a little more?

174
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,658
If you drink a little more?
-Huh

175
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,674
Because it's so hard.

176
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:07,501
delicious

177
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,455
His face was red.

178
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:10,579
is it?

179
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,337
I see that, Konomi-chan

180
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,817
Do you and Yusuke?

181
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:15,722
Huh?

182
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,507
I left it with

183
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,785
Is not it hard to make such a time?

184
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,304
Yep?

185
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,903
What are you talking about?
-sex

186
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,762
Do not talk about it.

187
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,246
It's original.
-I will not

188
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:32,883
I will not?
-Huh

189
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:35,054
You can not lie.

190
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:37,879
Let's talk about it.

191
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,873
Another story?
-Huh

192
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:42,927
I'm sorry I was worried.

193
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,114
I do not care.

194
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,290
How are you doing?

195
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,387
Huh?

196
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,793
If I'm Yusuke

197
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,316
I can not stand it.

198
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:54,418
Huh?

199
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,922
When I go to a convenience store?

200
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:58,365
Huh? What?

201
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,704
Do not hide.

202
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,188
What are you talking about?

203
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,277
Do not you have that desire?

204
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,028
Yes

205
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,818
Let's do it.

206
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,259
You can tell me.

207
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,484
Let's stop

208
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,309
His face is red.

209
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,710
drink

210
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:27,553
Which way?

211
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:28,908
what?

212
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:30,879
Have you ever been?

213
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,360
I will not

214
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,228
Why do you lie?

215
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:37,829
Everybody's doing it.

216
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:41,818
Conomi-chan

217
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:44,505
Do not
- My body is hot.

218
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:45,862
It's hot.

219
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:47,794
Close

220
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:50,971
Did you lighten up drinking?
-Huh

221
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,281
Do you feel strange?

222
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:56,336
Yeah, I do not.

223
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:00,505
Are you ticklish?
-Huh

224
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,157
Are you ticklish?

225
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:03,660
Ticklish

226
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,523
My face is red.

227
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:07,478
hot

228
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,534
It's a real sweat.

229
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:13,128
what?

230
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:15,927
Do not

231
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:17,325
Yusuke, touch these places?

232
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,282
I do not feel like touching.

233
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,809
I do not think so.

234
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,668
Do not
- I like this reaction.

235
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:26,398
Do not

236
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
If the whole body is sensitive

237
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:37,564
Is not this a weak one?

238
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,077
It's so desperate.

239
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,321
That's it, I'm dating my girlfriend.

240
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,878
Then give me one chance.

241
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,654
Chance?

242
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,502
I'll give you a nipple.

243
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,791
Because the accuracy is low.

244
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,797
Huh

245
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,682
right?
- Wrong.

246
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,298
Really?

247
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,831
No

248
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,068
You do not know if it's a lie.

249
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,085
Show me the correct answer.

250
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,799
Show me the correct answer.
-No

251
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:21,418
Show me the correct answer.

252
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,130
It's a lot of sweat.

253
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,490
Just a little, just the right answer.

254
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,191
Lightly, lightly

255
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,220
Is not it true?

256
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,240
Not right.

257
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:38,923
It is so pretty.

258
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:41,605
Why are you covering
- That's it.

259
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,584
It's fine because it's so beautiful.

260
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,399
Show me more.

261
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,171
I can see it.

262
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,270
Show everything

263
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,066
Do not

264
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,532
These places are sweating too.

265
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:07,723
hot

266
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,955
Here?

267
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,051
no

268
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,610
You're a big reaction.

269
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:31,374
Why are you worried?
This is not an affair.

270
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,729
It's wind.
- It's not the wind.

271
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,336
Everybody

272
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,076
Yes?
-Huh

273
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,319
Be big

274
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:44,843
It is very soft.

275
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:55,056
Yusuke will be fine too.

276
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:58,745
But Yu-chan does not touch it like that.

277
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:01,640
lie

278
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,170
What is it? Conomi-chan

279
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,234
Here?

280
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,289
Let's stop

281
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,395
I do not like this.

282
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,114
You have not even started yet.

283
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,628
Do you really want to do it?

284
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:01,975
Already a store?

285
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,724
It's wind.

286
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,558
The wind?
-Huh

287
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:08,018
Everybody's doing it.

288
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,700
Do you feel it here?

289
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:41,997
I can not be nervous.

290
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,361
I hear that.

291
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,946
I see everything.

292
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,876
Do not look.

293
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:15,941
What are you doing

294
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,169
Do not
- Is it hot? Conomi-chan

295
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,548
It's hot

296
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,806
Your ass is so pretty.

297
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,438
Where

298
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,240
Hate

299
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,586
Do not

300
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,537
I can not kiss you.

301
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:16,927
You have an affair.

302
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:18,467
It's okay.

303
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,922
You can just blame it on liquor.

304
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,322
No

305
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:57,726
You can not wash your chest.

306
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:59,381
No

307
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,470
Do not

308
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,045
Do not

309
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:33,718
It's getting bigger.

310
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,837
Are you always so sensitive?

311
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:39,988
no...

312
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,329
Probably not.

313
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:44,781
You do not really like it?

314
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:52,727
Hate

315
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,286
Show me your ass, ass.

316
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:14,472
I really need your ass.

317
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,048
Do not you think so too?

318
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,425
not really

319
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,000
Yusuke does not praise you?

320
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,449
hip?
-Huh

321
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,366
I will not.

322
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,848
That's weird.

323
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:36,858
What about the back?

324
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,724
Not the back.

325
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,332
Even if I do not like it,

326
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,733
Do you want to do more?

327
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,240
no

328
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,014
Really

329
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:50,379
Do not

330
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:52,674
Why?

331
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:55,215
Do you want to take a shower?

332
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,295
Did you want to take a shower?

333
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,411
Lots of sweat...

334
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:13,811
I lost a lot of sweat.
- That's good.

335
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,917
Hate

336
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:35,289
Where are you touching?

337
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,847
Did you reach your hand?
- I got it.

338
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,081
Where did you reach?

339
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,773
On the boat

340
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,334
navel?

341
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:46,655
no

342
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:48,075
where?

343
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,097
You got your hands.

344
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:57,291
Where did your hand touch?

345
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:00,840
here

346
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,657
It's a place you should not touch.

347
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:14,190
You can not touch it.

348
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,615
Tell me where you can not go.

349
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,247
I was soaked in my panties.

350
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,477
You can not touch it.

351
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,719
Is your country spreading?

352
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,200
You can not tighten it.

353
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,444
Why?

354
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:06,541
Do not

355
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:10,596
Do you feel it too much?

356
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,100
How did it go?

357
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,529
pretty

358
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,557
I'm really sensitive.

359
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,289
Are you helping?

360
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,371
no

361
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:39,718
I want it to stop.

362
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:44,238
I'll just look.

363
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,792
It's beautiful.

364
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,682
I think it's bad for Yusuke.

365
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,475
Are you done?

366
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,141
There's a dot, here.

367
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,239
point

368
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:12,390
point?

369
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:13,513
where?

370
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:14,910
here

371
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,362
I did not know
-I did not know?

372
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:19,444
I'll take a closer look.

373
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:20,674
It's too close.

374
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:25,706
Do not

375
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:34,809
No

376
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:36,806
It's dirty.

377
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:39,577
Do not suck.

378
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,200
Do not

379
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,649
It's beautiful.

380
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:41,584
No

381
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,332
I did not shower...

382
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,013
What about

383
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:49,459
Hate

384
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:50,872
It's also Yusuke.

385
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:09,958
Conomy-chan, are you here?

386
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,266
You can not be here.

387
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,329
Yusuke, is this what you do?

388
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:35,907
No no

389
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,112
Who ever did this?

390
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,307
Good mood?

391
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,444
Konomi-chan, where do you feel?

392
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:26,063
It's narrow.

393
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:28,926
My finger went in.

394
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,667
You can not put your finger on it.

395
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:41,203
He's already in.

396
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:43,379
Two

397
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,878
Two !?
-Huh

398
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:49,753
That's not it.

399
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,833
If you do it intensely...

400
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,167
Something came up.

401
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,349
sorry

402
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,136
Does this always happen?

403
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:26,998
I've never been out.
-Really?

404
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,799
So will you let me get more?

405
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:34,840
I'll touch you more.

406
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:38,263
Open wide

407
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,107
Is this good?

408
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,659
No no

409
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,796
Sorry

410
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,265
Why apologize?

411
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:19,997
So wet?

412
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,339
It's so wet.

413
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,003
I'm excited.

414
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:32,011
Please take care of this too

415
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,076
Suck it

416
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,988
Wash it?
-Huh

417
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,803
What can I do?

418
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,252
You've done it before.

419
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,053
No, that's it.

420
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:43,621
Yu Chan

421
00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:46,039
Then practice

422
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,433
Think of it as practice.
-Huh

423
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:50,859
practice...

424
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:10,519
It is very good

425
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,337
Good mood?

426
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:24,112
Could you get it done now?

427
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:25,232
uh

428
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:26,229
I'll stop.

429
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,716
Can you wash it deeper?

430
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,406
deep?

431
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,228
I can do it.

432
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,771
You're doing great.

433
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,579
I can not go anywhere. I feel good.

434
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,438
You can not wash straight.

435
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,388
I'm not keeping it.

436
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,038
Do you really want to do it?

437
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:58,530
Rinse together.

438
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:01,495
It's like this with Yusuke.

439
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,528
What

440
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,442
No no

441
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:28,333
Conomi-chan

442
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:31,786
I can not stand it.

443
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:33,150
Is it over now?
-Huh?

444
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,275
it's over?

445
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,029
What are you talking about?

446
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:37,756
What are you talking about?

447
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,468
What are you talking about?

448
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:44,647
What

449
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:51,645
Are you fine?

450
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:53,860
Conomi-chan, you piled up?

451
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,764
no no

452
00:34:56,455 --> 00:34:57,562
Are you trying to put it?

453
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:01,015
No no

454
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,033
I can not.

455
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:09,566
It's really an affair.

456
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,744
I do not change, I just put it in.

457
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:13,814
Hate

458
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,002
I can not.

459
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,142
Only glans

460
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,084
Hate

461
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,246
I did not do condoms.

462
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,632
It's good.

463
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:31,467
I do not have it.

464
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,979
Do you have Yusuke?
-there is

465
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,649
Let's do it.

466
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,488
I do not know where he is.

467
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,963
I know.

468
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,177
I will bring it

469
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,879
Let's condom
- I do not like it.

470
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:42,905
no

471
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,832
I will not be inside.
- I'll come with a condom.

472
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,493
I will not

473
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:47,710
Lightly

474
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,033
I'm outta here

475
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:49,845
no no

476
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:04,287
The sun went down...

477
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:06,586
Feeling good?

478
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,610
No

479
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:19,519
Subtract

480
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:24,054
You're still there.

481
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:29,553
I'm having an affair...

482
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:46,015
I have a condom and I have a condom...

483
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,919
Yes?
-No

484
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,793
Sometimes the no cone is good.

485
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:53,198
No

486
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,065
You can not do this...

487
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:09,985
You can not put it so deep.

488
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,738
Do not put it deep.

489
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,706
No no

490
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:39,718
Do not be violent.

491
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,616
Have you ever done it?

492
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:20,216
Doing this?

493
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:21,972
Not much.

494
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:37,333
Come in deep

495
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:41,739
No

496
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,990
I want to see your pretty ass.
-hip?

497
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:39,925
Show me your ass.

498
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:53,492
OK?
-Huh

499
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,668
Do you want more?

500
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,726
This is not possible.

501
00:41:45,513 --> 00:41:46,158
No

502
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:47,904
Please forgive

503
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:15,272
Go to bed?

504
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:04,833
Do not make it hard...

505
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,191
Cry?

506
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:07,742
Are you feeling good and crying?

507
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,864
Do not be too hard.

508
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,770
No

509
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,510
Conomi-chan

510
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,420
Are you jerking?

511
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:18,828
I will not

512
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:19,888
Did you go away?

513
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:21,751
OK?

514
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:24,864
here?

515
00:45:26,177 --> 00:45:27,385
It's weak inside.

516
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:39,415
It feels so good.

517
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,247
what?

518
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,587
telephone

519
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:47,002
Yusuke is not it?

520
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:50,940
telephone?

521
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:52,590
That's it.

522
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:53,432
It's Yusuke.

523
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,348
You can not.

524
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,152
What?

525
00:45:57,725 --> 00:45:58,779
You can not.
-receive

526
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:00,491
Hello

527
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,262
Yusuke

528
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:04,106
sorry

529
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:06,564
Now, Conomi-chan, I can not get a phone call

530
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:07,707
For me

531
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:13,195
like that

532
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,225
Ah

533
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:18,797
Conomi-chan, I think I can get it.
I'll change it.

534
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,251
Hello

535
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:31,500
Yu Chan

536
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:37,034
There's a lot of trouble.

537
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:42,743
Huh?

538
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:47,946
now

539
00:46:48,662 --> 00:46:50,966
I was learning...

540
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:54,527
That's right, so I breathe.

541
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,977
I'm not good at it.

542
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,564
OK...

543
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:35,554
That's right

544
00:47:43,206 --> 00:47:44,490
All right.

545
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:53,466
Huh

546
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:55,627
Are you coming soon?

547
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,843
Coming in half an hour?

548
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:01,176
All right.

549
00:48:04,372 --> 00:48:05,977
I do not need anything.

550
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:08,226
Carefully

551
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,943
come carefully

552
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:17,359
Bye Bye

553
00:48:22,229 --> 00:48:23,782
I'll be right back.

554
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,585
If it's 30 minutes

555
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:27,006
He will come.

556
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,189
Not enough

557
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,393
Did you actually want to do it?

558
00:48:48,632 --> 00:48:50,632
No no

559
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:21,496
Why did not you tell me to help you?

560
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:26,873
Tell me how...

561
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,278
Do you want to continue?

562
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:32,131
no

563
00:49:42,903 --> 00:49:44,763
Stop it?

564
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:47,765
Would you like me to stick it in?

565
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,995
He will come.

566
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,279
Until then,

567
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,931
I told you to be honest.

568
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,921
No

569
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:18,040
No

570
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:46,524
It's dangerous.

571
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:55,925
I think I will.

572
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:58,134
Do you think you will?

573
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,612
You said you would not go inside.

574
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:05,181
Good mood

575
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:06,379
Do not

576
00:51:07,181 --> 00:51:08,076
No

577
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:09,750
Do not be cheap

578
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:11,420
No

579
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,253
No

580
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:40,950
Is it really cheap?

581
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,413
It feels so good to see Konomi-chan

582
00:51:46,682 --> 00:51:47,605
It's okay.

583
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,411
It's really cheap...

584
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,949
So absurd

585
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:01,230
OK

586
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:05,987
Now that it's Yu-chan

587
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,672
We have to take a shower.

588
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:10,751
quickly

589
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:12,425
You can slow it down.

590
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:13,707
Let's shower

591
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:17,434
We have to make it fast
- All right.

{\ an8} - Making and distributing subtitles Cukdas.com -

593
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:39,706
I've been there.

594
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:44,966
Anyone else?

595
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,004
Conomy-chan?

596
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,491
Conomy-chan?
- Yoo-chan?

597
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:03,121
Huh

598
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:05,505
Come on
-Huh

599
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,786
Take a shower?

600
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:11,681
right

601
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:12,983
listen

602
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:15,651
... because I sweat

603
00:53:15,961 --> 00:53:17,218
like that

604
00:53:23,478 --> 00:53:25,326
Kohei went to a convenience store?

605
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:28,142
Yeah, I think I went to a convenience store.

606
00:53:28,511 --> 00:53:29,384
like that

607
00:53:30,142 --> 00:53:32,694
Okay, then I'll be over there.

608
00:53:33,347 --> 00:53:36,896
Yeah, it's over.
-Yeah

609
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,145
Why do I keep putting my finger

610
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:49,982
No

611
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:52,084
You came here.

612
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:13,010
I wrapped it too deep...

613
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:20,243
It's dangerous if you do not pull it all out.

614
00:54:20,944 --> 00:54:22,704
You're done.

615
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,417
It's still there.

616
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,381
It's all out.

617
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:30,080
It's okay, now.

618
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,314
It's been a while

619
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:34,950
more

620
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,126
I have to pull it out.

621
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:38,526
I can do it by myself.

622
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:45,920
I'll help you till the end.

623
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,915
I'm sticking my ass.

624
00:54:50,223 --> 00:54:52,223
Yoo came back.

625
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:04,142
No, that's it.

626
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,078
If you do so violently...

627
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,477
Conomi-chan

628
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:33,285
Touch it.

629
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:35,989
That's it.

630
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:38,141
I'm touching Konomi-chan.

631
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,781
It's getting bigger.

632
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:42,365
I just got wrapped up...

633
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,568
Why are you so excited?
- Why?

634
00:55:45,768 --> 00:55:47,768
I wanted to put it.
- That's it.

635
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,081
You have a good girl.

636
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:26,089
No

637
00:56:26,443 --> 00:56:27,959
Do not get violent...

638
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:29,700
You can hear it.

639
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:37,781
No no

00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,506
No

641
00:56:51,854 --> 00:56:54,543
I can hear her...

642
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:44,926
I think I will.

643
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:47,986
Do you think you will?

644
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:49,490
No

645
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,517
Not now.

646
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:51,956
You can just take it out.
-no

647
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:54,102
You can take it out.
-No

648
00:57:55,882 --> 00:57:56,914
Do not be cheap

Never.

No

652
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:39,272
It's also full of...

No

663
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:52,614
It's funny.

664
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,819
I can not stand now.

665

No

666
01:00:04,386 --> 01:00:05,906

No

668
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:25,255
Take it out.

669
01:00:39,362 --> 01:00:41,407
Konomi-chan, it was soaked.

670
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:44,661
No

672
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:53,049

Conomy-chan?

674
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:11,426
What is it?

675
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:12,934
Kohei?

676
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:15,910
Condomi-chan, have not you?

677
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:18,940
do not know

678
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:20,225
You were just there.

679
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:21,469
Yes, I did.

680
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,490
do not know?

681
01:01:24,093 --> 01:01:25,142
Did not you go to the store?

<i>I tried to hold me without worrying</i>

01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:38,506
I took ten years.

686
01:01:39,118 --> 01:01:40,376
You did not get caught?

687
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,288
OK

688
01:01:48,002 --> 01:01:49,608
Are you a little excited?

689
01:01:52,949 --> 01:01:54,529
Look at this.

690
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:08,468
I'll get it for the sound.

691
01:02:09,918 --> 01:02:11,089
It's a lie.

692
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:40,175
That's great.

693
01:02:42,622 --> 01:02:43,815
I think I will.

I want to put it
-No

697
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:03,213
Why?

698
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,193
I can not take it anymore.

699
01:03:10,241 --> 01:03:11,413
I'll get it soon.

700
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:13,022
I'll get it soon.

701
01:03:13,992 --> 01:03:15,097
I can not.

702
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:18,493
You can not.

703
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:21,293
It was wet.

704
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,347
It does not matter if you do not make a sound.

705
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:30,051
Sounds like...

706
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:16,860
Do not

01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,572
No

708
01:04:43,703 --> 01:04:44,803
I can not bear to groan.

709
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,900
I'll take her.

It looks like it's coming out.

713
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:04,001
No

714
01:06:04,563 --> 01:06:05,495
You can not afford it.

715
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:09,667
I feel so good

Something, than I thought.
I left the hook.

01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:55,715
Tomorrow night...

775
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,740
- Caption production, distribution Kukdasu dot com -

776
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,271
cold

777
01:11:00,983 --> 01:11:04,979
I lied to Konomi-chan,

778
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:10,526
Would you be surprised if I suddenly pop out of the veranda?

779
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:20,710
I worked as a dying person

780
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:22,819
This ring

781
01:11:25,053 --> 01:11:27,053
Would you be happy?

782
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,453
Why, Konomi

783
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:32,787
Good?

784
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,670
I told you it was good.

785
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,864
I like you too.

786
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:42,578
What's going on?

787
01:12:43,896 --> 01:12:45,896
I want to do this.

788
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:47,831
You've done a lot before.

789
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,319
Still not enough?
- Yeah, it's a little short.

790
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,214
How much do you have to do?

791
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,515
What if he's Yusuke?

792
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,038
Huh? Yoo-chan is fine.

793
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,153
I told you until morning.

794
01:13:02,331 --> 01:13:03,466
By morning?

795
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:06,358
I can not believe it.

796
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,433
right?

797
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:10,606
It's my birthday.

798
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,166
I'm lonely.
-Huh

799
01:13:17,502 --> 01:13:18,911
Lonely

800
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,390
I'm glad you're with me.

801
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,545
Like that?
- Yeah, good.

802
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:36,567
I just liked the sex I just had.

803
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:39,519
In fact, I
-Really?

804
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,083
I do not think it's enough yet.

805
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,068
Huh

806
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:56,207
Sincerity?

807
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:58,284
I want to do more.

808
01:13:58,384 --> 01:13:59,980
You want to do more?
-Huh

809
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:05,721
It feels good.

810
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:17,492
Do you mind?

811
01:14:29,106 --> 01:14:31,620
Compared to Yusuke?

812
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,483
Tough

813
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,029
What do you think?

814
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:47,716
Good mood

815
01:14:55,762 --> 01:14:58,035
It's easy to take off.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

816
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:00,573
Is it hot?

817
01:15:02,787 --> 01:15:04,787
Could you peel it off?
-Huh

818
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,373
So me too

819
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,730
Thanks

820
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:18,796
Kohei-kun, it's sweet.

821
01:15:18,865 --> 01:15:19,854
Is not it?

822
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,616
Me too, Yu-chan

823
01:15:38,804 --> 01:15:40,933
I think he likes Kohei more.

824
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:42,292
What is that

825
01:15:45,876 --> 01:15:48,619
Because if you had not met Kohei

826
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:51,640
I do not think sex would feel so good.

827
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:53,975
Yes?
-Huh

828
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:57,043
I'll break up with Yu-chan.

829
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:58,440
Come with me.

830
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:01,960
No?

831
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:03,680
Sorry about Yusuke.

832
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:06,056
Okay, Yoo-chan

833
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:09,370
with me

834
01:16:09,573 --> 01:16:11,912
Be a friend after you break up with me.

835
01:16:12,313 --> 01:16:13,771
I'm sorry.

836
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:17,106
I can not do that.

837
01:16:17,795 --> 01:16:18,915
Why?

838
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,542
Date with me

839
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:39,691
I

840
01:16:40,024 --> 01:16:42,024
I'll do anything.

841
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:51,199
For Kohei
I can do it.

842
01:17:03,526 --> 01:17:04,551
Kohei

843
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:06,990
Lie on the couch.

844
01:17:10,777 --> 01:17:11,854
It's hard.

845
01:17:12,948 --> 01:17:13,870
sorry

846
01:17:14,081 --> 01:17:16,088
You've done it a while ago.

847
01:17:16,621 --> 01:17:18,375
I still do not have enough

848
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:19,758
Is not enough?

849
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,680
I stood up

850
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:24,954
It is very hard.

851
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:39,372
What about this one?

852
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:41,593
this way

853
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:42,748
this way?

854
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:44,698
Can I suck it?

855
01:17:54,776 --> 01:17:55,771
Good mood?

856
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:56,800
All right

857
01:17:57,866 --> 01:17:58,910
happy

858
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:07,016
Have not you done anything like this to Yusuke?

859
01:18:07,386 --> 01:18:08,004
Huh

860
01:18:10,014 --> 01:18:12,125
I'm not Kohei.

861
01:18:14,368 --> 01:18:16,368
I'm sorry about that.

862
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:16,984
Huh?

863
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:27,671
Do the other side too.

864
01:18:36,716 --> 01:18:38,406
Good mood?

865
01:18:47,731 --> 01:18:50,796
I'm glad you feel Kohei.

866
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:55,900
you're good

867
01:18:56,446 --> 01:18:57,703
Really?
-Huh

868
01:19:09,967 --> 01:19:11,229
Can I suck here too?

869
01:19:15,565 --> 01:19:16,952
It's awesome.

870
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:19,076
It's so big.

871
01:19:19,618 --> 01:19:21,994
I just went to Love Hotel twice.

872
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:42,091
Good mood?

873
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,917
Kohei's cock is delicious

874
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:56,004
Tell me and tell me

875
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:00,985
Kohei's cock is delicious

876
01:20:01,716 --> 01:20:02,868
So good

877
01:20:19,499 --> 01:20:20,937
because

878
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:25,053
You build it a few times.

879
01:20:28,631 --> 01:20:30,498
It's because Konomi is cute.

880
01:20:34,398 --> 01:20:36,398
So will you come with me?

881
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:40,036
That's another story.

882
01:20:40,115 --> 01:20:41,654
Why?

883
01:20:47,757 --> 01:20:49,597
That's how you do it

884
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,336
Thanks

885
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,740
I sweat.

886
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:01,927
I am sweaty because I am fast

887
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:04,487
Look at me.

888
01:21:05,114 --> 01:21:06,498
Looking at me

889
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:21,125
Kohei, do you like this?

890
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:23,678
right

891
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,629
I'm really done.

892
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:38,975
I can do anything for Kohei.

893
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:39,956
Is not it hard?

894
01:21:40,388 --> 01:21:42,733
Yeah, it's hard.

895
01:21:42,956 --> 01:21:45,293
I still want to feel it.

896
01:21:54,263 --> 01:21:55,828
Good mood?
-Good mood

897
01:22:02,604 --> 01:22:04,360
Deeper

898
01:22:09,736 --> 01:22:10,726
Can you do it fast?

899
01:22:10,878 --> 01:22:12,092
Quickly...

900
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:26,100
Too large

901
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:31,807
Also suck the balls.

902
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:34,967
this way?

903
01:22:44,747 --> 01:22:45,813
Suck it

904
01:23:00,137 --> 01:23:01,085
Do not weave?

905
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:05,100
delicious

906
01:23:05,696 --> 01:23:06,556
delicious?
-Huh

907
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:07,454
What flavor?

908
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,594
I'm not squeezing.

909
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:16,573
Wear it?

910
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,892
Who better to build Yusuke?

911
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:23,861
What do you mean

912
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,550
Does not Yusuke do this?

913
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:27,818
I have not played Yu

914
01:23:29,393 --> 01:23:30,890
Then do it.

915
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:39,626
this?
-right

916
01:23:53,407 --> 01:23:54,474
I feel good there

917
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,915
Good mood?
-Huh

918
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:58,281
I'll suck you.

919
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,825
This is only for Kohei.

920
01:24:13,987 --> 01:24:14,838
Really?

921
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,298
Will we meet?

922
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:25,706
right

923
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:28,176
I forgot

924
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:28,872
what?

925
01:24:29,215 --> 01:24:30,173
I have a present.

926
01:24:30,471 --> 01:24:31,749
Gift?

927
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,636
Give me the bag.

928
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,235
Now, gifts

929
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,778
Thanks

930
01:24:46,574 --> 01:24:48,121
What?

931
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:52,385
what is this

932
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,933
It's a crazy toy.

933
01:24:55,063 --> 01:24:56,593
I know?

934
01:24:57,086 --> 01:24:58,635
Denmage?
-Huh

935
01:24:58,818 --> 01:24:59,726
this

936
01:25:00,052 --> 01:25:01,107
A gift?
-right

937
01:25:02,212 --> 01:25:03,244
No, really.

938
01:25:04,213 --> 01:25:05,326
How do you do this?

939
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:07,873
It's better than nothing.

940
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:09,737
No, I'm glad.

941
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:12,478
What did Yusuke do?

942
01:25:12,776 --> 01:25:16,390
No, maybe Yu-chan did not prepare anything.

943
01:25:17,007 --> 01:25:18,151
Let's write.

944
01:25:18,557 --> 01:25:19,136
Huh

945
01:25:19,594 --> 01:25:20,685
How do you write it?

946
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:22,580
I'll tell you

947
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:24,992
come here

948
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:26,429
sit down
-Yeah

949
01:25:40,121 --> 01:25:41,629
Find a nice place.

950
01:25:42,235 --> 01:25:42,792
Huh

951
01:25:43,488 --> 01:25:44,462
I feel good

952
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:45,785
Good mood?
-Huh

953
01:25:46,637 --> 01:25:48,176
It's not a normal massage.

954
01:25:48,729 --> 01:25:49,234
Huh?

955
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:00,933
I feel good
-Good mood? -Huh

956
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:14,809
Look up your clothes.

957
01:26:15,377 --> 01:26:16,769
this?
-Huh

958
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:32,917
Do you feel the depth?
- Yes, I'm trembling.

959
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,476
Is this your first time?

960
01:26:43,148 --> 01:26:43,850
Huh

961
01:26:45,148 --> 01:26:46,904
This is my first time writing this.

962
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:49,206
Yusuke does not do anything.

963
01:26:50,301 --> 01:26:52,864
Is not it too much for the first time?

964
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:56,316
Yoo-chan does not give me any of this.

965
01:26:58,531 --> 01:27:00,086
Is not it interesting?

966
01:27:01,707 --> 01:27:02,889
Is that so?

967
01:27:08,024 --> 01:27:10,449
I feel so good.

968
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,138
Let's face it.

969
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,392
Look up

970
01:27:18,569 --> 01:27:20,498
This? -Huh
- You can take off.

971
01:27:21,607 --> 01:27:22,961
Do you sweat a lot?

972
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:24,098
hot

973
01:27:29,649 --> 01:27:31,093
You cool?
-Huh

974
01:27:31,187 --> 01:27:31,896
It's cool.

975
01:27:34,227 --> 01:27:35,803
Hold your arm.

976
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,325
like this?
-Huh

977
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,295
I'll find a nice place.
- I do not like the armpit.

978
01:27:43,537 --> 01:27:45,230
I really do not like it.

979
01:27:46,703 --> 01:27:47,935
It's tickling.

980
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:53,801
Good mood

981
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,195
Good mood?
-Huh

982
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:22,902
Can we do it here?

983
01:28:36,988 --> 01:28:38,988
Comfortably
-Yeah

984
01:29:02,984 --> 01:29:04,271
Where do you feel?

985
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:11,788
Near

986
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:16,547
there

987
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,460
Let me know.

988
01:29:22,776 --> 01:29:24,776
Place it in the middle.

989
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:31,495
Good mood

990
01:30:21,308 --> 01:30:22,661
Good mood

991
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:37,759
kiss Me

992
01:30:46,972 --> 01:30:47,934
I like you

993
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:51,078
DENMA?

994
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,171
no

995
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:54,474
no

996
01:30:54,833 --> 01:31:00,213
Kohei

997
01:31:07,189 --> 01:31:08,116
I think I'm going.

998
01:31:12,028 --> 01:31:12,986
I think I'm going.

999
01:31:32,782 --> 01:31:34,562
I'll make you feel better.

1000
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:35,721
Really?

1001
01:31:40,302 --> 01:31:41,560
Hold it.

1002
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:43,110
like this?
-Yes

1003
01:31:44,822 --> 01:31:45,933
I have a mark.

1004
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,456
It's moving.

1005
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:21,090
Near

1006
01:32:26,662 --> 01:32:28,662
I feel good there

1007
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:05,229
Would you like another place elsewhere?

1008
01:33:05,941 --> 01:33:07,333
Give me your ass.

1009
01:33:08,242 --> 01:33:10,242
hip?
-Huh

1010
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:12,356
Give me your ass.

1011
01:33:23,353 --> 01:33:25,490
I sweat in my ass again.

1012
01:33:26,911 --> 01:33:28,606
Sorry

1013
01:33:28,821 --> 01:33:30,447
I know everything.

1014
01:33:49,715 --> 01:33:51,879
Put it in a nice place

1015
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:02,679
Waist shake

1016
01:34:04,674 --> 01:34:05,820
like this?

1017
01:34:07,417 --> 01:34:09,219
Rub in a nice place.

1018
01:34:39,574 --> 01:34:40,511
Do you like direct?

1019
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,627
directly?

1020
01:34:58,144 --> 01:35:00,426
Use your hand to open it.

1021
01:35:01,009 --> 01:35:02,370
Easy to wait

1022
01:35:04,826 --> 01:35:05,923
like this?

1023
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:09,590
Can you use both hands?

1024
01:35:13,269 --> 01:35:14,224
Give it to me?

1025
01:35:14,646 --> 01:35:15,368
Huh

1026
01:35:17,893 --> 01:35:19,488
I'll put you in the middle.
-Huh

1027
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:29,359
I feel good there.
-Huh

1028
01:35:29,706 --> 01:35:31,102
Good mood

1029
01:35:31,201 --> 01:35:32,843
Is not it just getting away?

1030
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,722
I think I'm going.

1031
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:03,299
I think I'm going...

1032
01:36:17,983 --> 01:36:19,063
Then by practice

1033
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:20,779
Do you want to play it yourself?

1034
01:36:20,961 --> 01:36:22,154
I?
-Huh

1035
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:26,273
I can take this off.

1036
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,320
Look good
-Yeah

1037
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:44,942
Sit over there

1038
01:36:45,147 --> 01:36:46,571
This way?
-Huh

1039
01:36:50,029 --> 01:36:51,721
Sounds familiar.

1040
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:55,545
Can you do it well?

1041
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:11,518
Make sure you're wearing it straight.

1042
01:37:15,377 --> 01:37:16,429
It's very wet.

1043
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:48,027
Let me know when I'm going.

1044
01:38:03,743 --> 01:38:05,201
He's gone

1045
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,913
I bought them

1046
01:38:15,373 --> 01:38:16,332
No

1047
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,030
Was it good?

1048
01:38:42,187 --> 01:38:43,660
Conomy?
-Huh

1049
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:51,568
Are you tired?

1050
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:55,027
I felt good.

1051
01:38:56,881 --> 01:38:58,935
So will you go before Yusuke comes?

1052
01:39:02,822 --> 01:39:03,891
store?

1053
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:05,377
Huh

1054
01:39:05,753 --> 01:39:06,826
You were satisfied.

1055
01:39:06,944 --> 01:39:09,200
Not yet...

1056
01:39:09,757 --> 01:39:11,153
Still not enough?

1057
01:39:11,175 --> 01:39:12,424
Let's have sex

1058
01:39:12,499 --> 01:39:14,125
I want to?
- Yes, I want to.

1059
01:39:15,426 --> 01:39:16,773
how will we do it

1060
01:39:26,738 --> 01:39:27,808
Okay, then

1061
01:39:38,841 --> 01:39:40,409
Do you want to do it one more time?

1062
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:43,169
I thought so.

1063
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,906
I want to do it again.

1064
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:04,659
Good mood

1065
01:40:33,426 --> 01:40:34,250
Also

1066
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:36,671
I like the feeling of Kohei's cock.

1067
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:52,625
Good mood

1068
01:40:56,143 --> 01:40:57,474
Kohei Islands feel good?

1069
01:40:57,577 --> 01:40:58,978
Good mood

1070
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:25,006
I got a bunch of them.

1071
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:28,020
what is this

1072
01:41:28,688 --> 01:41:29,572
It's the taste of Konomi.

1073
01:41:32,728 --> 01:41:34,784
Did I lose it?
-Right

1074
01:41:36,216 --> 01:41:37,229
Give me

1075
01:41:37,454 --> 01:41:38,255
needle

1076
01:41:41,072 --> 01:41:42,525
Spit it out.

1077
01:42:06,425 --> 01:42:07,810
I like you

1078
01:42:27,234 --> 01:42:30,210
It's the happiest sex I have with Kohei.

1079
01:42:55,256 --> 01:42:56,214
Good mood

1080
01:43:17,545 --> 01:43:18,640
Can you move?

1081
01:44:07,756 --> 01:44:09,581
Yusuke can not do this?

1082
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:11,495
I'm scared, I'm scared.

1083
01:44:14,006 --> 01:44:15,515
Hold tight.

1084
01:44:15,645 --> 01:44:16,607
I'll fall.

1085
01:44:20,814 --> 01:44:22,524
It's good to be strong.

1086
01:44:30,091 --> 01:44:31,819
Good mood

1087
01:44:46,966 --> 01:44:48,324
Good mood

1088
01:45:36,746 --> 01:45:38,258
Good mood

1089
01:45:48,746 --> 01:45:50,174
It feels good.

1090
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,809
more?

1091
01:46:01,711 --> 01:46:02,925
Give me more...

1092
01:46:36,373 --> 01:46:37,744
I will move.

1093
01:46:38,381 --> 01:46:39,602
Can you move?

1094
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,549
I'll try.

1095
01:47:00,444 --> 01:47:01,711
Good mood

1096
01:47:17,276 --> 01:47:20,358
I'm in a good mood so I can not stop my back.

1097
01:48:24,828 --> 01:48:25,920
I like you

1098
01:48:26,963 --> 01:48:28,187
So good

1099
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:03,325
Good mood

1100
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,662
I feel good there

1101
01:49:12,772 --> 01:49:13,964
Good mood?
-Huh

1102
01:49:40,893 --> 01:49:42,893
I feel so good

1103
01:49:44,739 --> 01:49:45,888
It's awesome

1104
01:49:57,061 --> 01:49:58,529
I like you

1105
01:50:12,976 --> 01:50:15,214
Come with me.

1106
01:50:16,202 --> 01:50:18,202
So what about Yusuke?

1107
01:50:21,707 --> 01:50:24,509
do not say that

1108
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,288
Good mood

1109
01:51:06,078 --> 01:51:06,724
What do you think?

1110
01:51:07,497 --> 01:51:08,574
Do more

1111
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:34,999
Do you think it's rice?

1112
01:51:36,879 --> 01:51:38,258
Do you want to be cheap?

1113
01:51:40,491 --> 01:51:42,561
Inside me.

1114
01:51:47,671 --> 01:51:49,821
Will you fill it in?

1115
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,840
It flows in...

1116
01:53:00,602 --> 01:53:02,115
It's full.

1117
01:53:02,682 --> 01:53:03,568
Happy

1118
01:53:15,029 --> 01:53:16,242
Suck it
-Yeah

1119
01:53:20,621 --> 01:53:21,498
Good mood

1120
01:53:22,237 --> 01:53:23,444
Good mood?

1121
01:53:32,557 --> 01:53:34,294
It felt so good, did not it?

1122
01:53:34,901 --> 01:53:35,357
Yeah

1123
01:53:37,776 --> 01:53:39,470
I still feel good

1124
01:53:39,918 --> 01:53:42,405
Could you do it one more time?

1125
01:53:44,407 --> 01:53:46,190
I want to?

1126
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:51,989
You want to put it again?

1127
01:54:13,956 --> 01:54:15,541
Good mood

1128
01:54:21,186 --> 01:54:22,374
Good mood

1129
01:54:37,818 --> 01:54:40,121
Good mood?
-Good mood

1130
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:41,547
I'm glad

1131
01:54:42,649 --> 01:54:44,649
Show me what's inside.

1132
01:55:03,152 --> 01:55:04,693
Good mood

1133
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,384
Good mood

1134
01:55:25,511 --> 01:55:26,756
Good mood?
-Huh

1135
01:55:27,116 --> 01:55:28,046
I also

1136
01:55:46,546 --> 01:55:47,803
I think I'm going...

1137
01:56:11,275 --> 01:56:12,859
I think it's rice again.

1138
01:56:33,368 --> 01:56:35,661
It's filled in.

1139
01:56:53,826 --> 01:56:54,841
It's awesome.

1140
01:56:54,949 --> 01:56:56,949
It is packed twice.

1141
01:57:02,686 --> 01:57:04,424
It's because of Konomi.

1142
01:57:06,695 --> 01:57:08,768
Kohei is great.

1143
01:57:09,232 --> 01:57:11,091
I like the cock so much.

1144
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,967
Let's have sex this morning.

1145
01:57:26,572 --> 01:57:28,154
Yusuke is coming.

1146
01:57:29,082 --> 01:57:30,725
Yoo-chan is now

1147
01:57:30,885 --> 01:57:31,579
done

1148
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:44,260
Kohei, I really like it.

1149
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:46,725
I like you

1150
01:57:48,908 --> 01:57:50,170
I like it a lot

1151
01:58:26,663 --> 01:58:27,441
Is it a dream?

1152
01:58:36,611 --> 01:58:38,611
Are you here yet?

1153
01:58:41,974 --> 01:58:43,793
Let's get taxed

1154
01:59:07,846 --> 01:59:08,655
Good mood

1155
01:59:25,946 --> 01:59:27,244
Suck more

1156
01:59:34,512 --> 01:59:35,928
Good mood

1157
01:59:43,313 --> 01:59:44,390
Kohei

1158
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:46,308
I really like it.

1159
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:57,868
Who is it?

1160
01:59:58,477 --> 01:59:59,150
Yu-chan !?

1161
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:01,031
There's more behind

1162
02:00:01,328 --> 02:00:10,860

1163
02:00:11,458 --> 02:00:13,458
Look at this.

1164
02:00:13,757 --> 02:00:14,965
Why are you taking

1165
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,070
It's good.
-Do not

1166
02:00:16,528 --> 02:00:17,913
If you leave here

1167
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,137
Masturbating while watching this

1168
02:00:21,775 --> 02:00:22,546
Look here.

1169
02:00:35,878 --> 02:00:36,767
Why?

1170
02:00:39,184 --> 02:00:40,173
What is it?

1171
02:00:40,554 --> 02:00:41,423
there is?

1172
02:00:41,657 --> 02:00:42,342
uh

1173
02:00:42,461 --> 02:00:44,461
Was not it Konomi-chan?

1174
02:00:46,533 --> 02:00:48,659
I do not know.

1175
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:50,016
I was there.

1176
02:00:51,334 --> 02:00:52,098
do not know?

1177
02:00:52,656 --> 02:00:53,723
Did not you go to the store?

1178
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:57,557
Go to the store?
- Uh, I thought there was something I wanted to buy.

1179
02:00:57,667 --> 02:00:58,363
Really?

1180
02:00:58,533 --> 02:00:59,860
I still have shoes.

1181
02:01:00,348 --> 02:01:02,938
Are you wearing sandals?

1182
02:01:03,125 --> 02:01:05,797
No way, it's so cold.

1183
02:01:08,404 --> 02:01:10,000
Well

1184
02:01:10,086 --> 02:01:12,902
I think it was a while ago.
Who are you talking to now?

1185
02:01:13,631 --> 02:01:14,451
no

1186
02:01:14,837 --> 02:01:15,888
What is the veranda?

1187
02:01:16,108 --> 02:01:18,181
It was not on the veranda.

1188
02:01:18,764 --> 02:01:19,675
Yes?

1189
02:01:20,463 --> 02:01:22,463
He went to see a store.

1190
02:01:23,191 --> 02:01:25,635
No, I think he's at home...

1191
02:01:29,207 --> 02:01:30,472
I do not have it.

1192
02:01:31,185 --> 02:01:32,616
Yes?
-uh

1193
02:01:36,181 --> 02:01:38,516
I can not concentrate on the bathroom.
-Why

1194
02:01:39,354 --> 02:01:42,185
There's no way out.

1195
02:01:42,433 --> 02:01:44,126
Have you used the bathroom so long?

1196
02:01:44,216 --> 02:01:46,514
Me, long time.
- Did not you come out soon?

1197
02:01:47,062 --> 02:01:48,617
it is not so

1198
02:01:49,093 --> 02:01:51,274
What are you doing?

1199
02:01:51,465 --> 02:01:53,108
I'm not doing it.

1200
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:56,396
I will not

1201
02:01:56,827 --> 02:01:58,051
What, you

1202
02:01:58,983 --> 02:02:00,576
Konomi-chan, where are you going?

1203
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,310
I can not concentrate.

1204
02:02:04,879 --> 02:02:07,029
Conomi-chan, are you out there?

1205
02:02:07,527 --> 02:02:08,860
is it?

1206
02:02:09,997 --> 02:02:12,581
I'll look for it.

1207
02:02:13,496 --> 02:02:14,700
It's strange...
