1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,637
永无止境的黑暗

2
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,545
我们都很笨拙的人

3
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,050
但我很勇敢，我很坚强

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,553
不管谁来，只是闭上我的眼睛

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,747
我不想听。不要说话。

6
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,551
不要告诉我应该做什么

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,058
Even though I'm brave

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,755
I'm always alone, I know it already

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,057
I'm already bruised

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,564
Life's a jungle with no answers

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,157
I'm lonely, sad and lost

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,760
I'm trapped in here
This tiny grey building

13
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,362
We're all trapped, floating in air

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,873
Hear the car horn beep, beep

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,772
We have nowhere to turn

16
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,777
Can you help us?

17
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,575
Who will trust us? We're trapped

18
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:56,180
19 years old right now

19
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:02,286
Nineteen

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,188
Jeong-hun

21
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,596
Min-seo

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,705
Min-seo, what are you doing?

23
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,505
What are you doing down there?
Always singing strange songs

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,315
Aren't you going to school?

25
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,114
School? No, I go to work today

26
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,815
Skipping class for a measly casual job

27
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,119
This is my seat

28
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,925
Hey! I marked that page

29
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,625
Don't study at the table
It ruins everyone's appetite

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,133
I'm not the same as you

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,233
How are we different?

32
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,831
I go to a good university,
I'm going to be an accountant

33
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,137
You go to a poor university
which you hardly ever attend

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,542
- Not again!
- She's right

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,738
Father...

36
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,838
You need to think about the future

37
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,246
I am thinking about the future

38
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,548
- Not hard enough
- Watch it

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,145
You won't get a job with your degree

40
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,158
You're already on your way
to becoming a failure

41
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,856
You should study to acquire a license

42
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,960
Hurry up and eat

43
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,968
Yes, eat up so you can go
earn lots of money today

44
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,367
Close your book

45
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,871
- Hey!
- Watch your manners!

46
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,971
I'm going

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,576
Jeong-hun! Have breakfast!

48
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,187
What's wrong with him...?

49
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,505
Eun-a!

50
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,511
Oh... hi

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,311
You weren't answering my calls

52
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,819
- Have you been ill?
- I'm fine

53
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,323
You don't look good
You should see a doctor

54
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,517
No, I'm fine

55
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,824
Let's make sure, see a doctor

56
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,523
I am seeing a doctor

57
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,535
- Who's he?
- My boyfriend

58
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,232
Boyfriend?

59
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,039
I'm your boyfriend

60
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,342
This is Su-bin, he's a med student

61
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,988
- How are you feeling?
- I told you not to come

62
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:23,392
- I finished early today
- They're so pretty, thanks

63
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,987
I picked them from the garden

64
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,295
- How's work going?
- Not bad

65
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,494
I want to see

66
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,705
The manager says I'm good

67
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,708
She lets me help style customers too

68
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,507
Did you design these hairstyles?

69
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,312
- It's nothing
- They're good

70
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:50,622
I don't need to worry about
you when I'm gone

71
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,524
Don't say that.
You're going to get better

72
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,027
- Hello?
- Where are you?

73
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,538
Get down here now! We're busy!

74
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:12,340
Sorry, but my mom's ill
I'm at the hospital

75
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,843
Don't give me that excuse.

76
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,939
You're old enough to look after yourself

77
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,541
You're 19, an adult

78
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,645
I pay you wages,
you should take responsibility

79
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,351
Should I stay at work even
though my mother's dying?

80
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,657
Are you shouting at me?

81
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,356
I'm sorry, what I meant was...

82
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,558
You're just an assistant

83
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,761
Don't talk back to me like that

84
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,861
I don't need you, you're fired!

85
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,372
Hello? Hello?

86
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,586
- Hello? I'm sorry about...
- Eun-yeong?

87
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,392
- Yes, speaking...
- It's me...

88
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,592
Are you feeling ill, Min-seo?

89
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,099
I'm fine

90
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,193
Should we go to dad's hospital?

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,202
No, I'm fine

92
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:16,503
Have some cake then, I made it

93
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,409
I ordered the butter from Switzerland

94
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,411
You eat it, then

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,416
I made it for you, it's good for you

96
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,009
You need to be strong to study

97
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,419
Study hard, go to university next year

98
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,424
- I'm going out
- Where are you going?

99
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,516
The library

100
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,827
I'm starting another day

101
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,734
Turning on the lights

102
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,438
Who put that cup there?

103
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,439
If I catch them, there'll be trouble

104
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,545
You scared me!

105
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,048
- Boss!
- You're here

106
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,949
Could you help Yeong-ae clean up?

107
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,147
Yeong-ae, take this with you

108
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,163
- What's wrong with her?
- She said she's going to quit

109
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,169
Why?

110
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,175
She got a part in a film
wants to concentrate on her career

111
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,575
I heard she went to acting school

112
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,481
I paid her a high wage too
I guess she's not desperate

113
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,488
You have me here
I'll stand by your side

114
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,082
Thanks a lot

115
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,994
Should I just give up school
and come here everyday?

116
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,291
You're just being kind

117
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,697
You're the kind one for
hiring a fool like me!

118
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,898
I'm going to my son's school
I won't be back until lunch

119
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,701
You're the man in charge

120
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,502
Don't worry

121
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,709
See you later

122
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,830
You scared me

123
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,529
- You're good
- At what? Sucking up?

124
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,938
You sound like a real rapper
You're good

125
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,134
It's nothing

126
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,143
You should try out
for auditions

127
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,838
You know, rap battles

128
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,540
That's too difficult

129
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,550
You have to make up
lyrics freestyle

130
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,746
Just say what comes
to mind naturally

131
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,551
The lyrics will be depressing then

132
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,353
Why? Are you depressed?

133
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,655
That's the story of my life

134
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,261
Tell me about your life,
I'll listen

135
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,561
I don't have anything to say

136
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,865
You're so slow
I'm asking you out on a date

137
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,669
You're what?

138
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,666
Do I have to do all the work?

139
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,679
I liked you from the beginning

140
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:16,587
- No way Really?
- Why? I'm not your type?

141
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,888
No, that's not it

142
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,891
Girls like you always have boyfriends

143
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,092
I don't date girls like that...
I don't even try

144
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,000
I never imagined that a girl
like that would ask me out

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,799
I don't talk to them because...

146
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,306
What I mean is... I'm trying to say...

147
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,014
I'm free... whenever you are

148
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,616
Hang out with me after work?

149
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,214
With you?

150
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,125
I'm coming

151
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,721
I'll get it

152
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,632
Hello.

153
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,132
- It's $1 an hour, you can sit...
- I'm a member

154
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,339
Pick any seat

155
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,074
Hello. Are you a member?

156
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,481
- I'm looking for someone
- Who?

157
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,485
Is Yeong-ae here? I'm her friend

158
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,887
Yeong-ae, your friend's here

159
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,895
I don't care about your dreams

160
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,192
Eun-yeong, please

161
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,701
I came here to
make things clear

162
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,294
I can't do it, I refuse to

163
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,708
What gives you the right to ask me?

164
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,409
I asked because you're my friend

165
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,915
My answer's still no
Don't call me again

166
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,211
Eun-yeong...

167
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:54,945
- Hey... will you protect me?
- Of course I will I'll protect you

168
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,747
- You will?
- I give you my word

169
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,772
You have to watch over me. Promise me

170
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:33,784
Follow me

171
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,086
Who did it? Tell them to all come out

172
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:44,890
I'll get them all!

173
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,906
- Are we...
- What is it? Tell me

174
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,808
Are we going to meet again?
Are we going out?

175
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,512
I don't know

176
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,816
Why not?

177
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,224
How about if we
just live together?

178
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,828
Live together?

179
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,926
We're both 19... wouldn't it be fun?

180
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:33,443
People don't think fondly of unmarried
couples living together

181
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:38,345
My parents are really conservative

182
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,351
I'm just kidding

183
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,153
You're going to protect me, right?

184
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,294
See you tomorrow!

185
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,916
An adult, yet still a child

186
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,926
Yearning for independence

187
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,726
Endless opportunities

188
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:05,532
An age of transition...
We were at that age, 19

189
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,641
- Look!
- What?

190
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,540
Her wallet's here...
she didn't get mugged

191
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,445
You're right...what's this?

192
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,949
She must have gone to a club

193
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:27,958
A club??

194
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,963
A nightclub that kids go to

195
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,260
Where's her cell phone?

196
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,769
I don't see it. Maybe she dropped it

197
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,565
Or someone threw it in the river

198
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,774
We've got a smart one on our hands

199
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,578
Mom! I don't have school today

200
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,485
Where were you last night?

201
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,389
Why do you care? Let me sleep

202
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,984
- The police are here
- What?

203
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,593
- Are you Seo Jeong-hun?
- Yes, why do you ask?

204
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,996
- Do you know Oh Yeong-ae?
- Oh Yeong-ae?

205
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,805
What's happened?

206
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,800
Her body was found along the river

207
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,003
What?

208
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,407
You must be joking

209
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,517
What does my son have to do with it?

210
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,820
You'll need to come to the station

211
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,623
Around 1:30 last night at the southern
end of the Han River

212
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,728
A witness says they saw someone

213
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,030
push a young girl into the water

214
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,027
I don't believe it

215
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,636
Who would do that to Yeong-ae?

216
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,043
You worked together?

217
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:57,048
Yes, it's been about 6 months

218
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,047
- Were you close?
- Excuse me?

219
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
I'm just asking if you were friends

220
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,456
Were you?

221
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,463
We chatted while working sometimes

222
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,461
That's all

223
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,861
Are you a student?

224
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,372
I'm a freshman at Samhwa University

225
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,067
What's your major?

226
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,666
Humanities and cultural studies

227
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,076
What's that?

228
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:34,683
The stylist attends to the customer
I help out and learn the ropes

229
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,084
You're just a junior then

230
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,679
We're referred to as staff

231
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,189
Have you learnt a lot?

232
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,485
- It doesn't matter now
- Why not?

233
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,187
- I got fired
- When was that?

234
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,786
- Yesterday
- Why did you get fired?

235
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,196
I talked back to the boss
She fired me

236
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,499
I would have done the same
So you were mad

237
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,506
Your friend was murdered
yesterday too

238
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,098
It's got nothing to do with me

239
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,907
It's got nothing to do with you?
Isn't this camera yours?

240
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,111
Is it yours?

241
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,412
We went to a club, then...

242
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,712
Where did you go afterwards?

243
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,921
- Home
- Did you head straight home?

244
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,118
You don't remember?
You can't think?

245
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,823
No! I mean yes, no!

246
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,831
We went to the river for some air

247
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,423
You got some fresh air and...

248
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,734
We just talked and went home early

249
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,232
I mean it, we went home early

250
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,743
You mean early in the morning...

251
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,238
You don't know anything?

252
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,840
Your friend died
but you know nothing

253
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,545
- You're not even sad?
- It's unfortunate what happened

254
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,147
She's a school mate
but we were never close

255
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,149
She's not really my friend

256
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,858
Is that why she called
you every day?

257
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,763
Tell me who took
these photos then

258
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,166
Your father's
a famous businessman

259
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,173
You shouldn't get messed up like this

260
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,472
Did you tell my parents?

261
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,171
What?

262
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,681
We looked at Yeong-ae's call records

263
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,879
She called you last week 6 times in fact

264
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,784
That's because...

265
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,187
You're a precious son at home

266
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,386
I've met mama boys
like you before

267
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,493
You can't even go chat up a girl

268
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,795
You follow them around in hiding

269
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,804
Take photos of them like a pervert

270
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,499
She probably accused you of stalking her

271
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,010
You were embarrassed, got angry...

272
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,204
Fine then! She called me for money

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,712
Money?

274
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,407
She kept asking to borrow money

275
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,516
I work so she thinks
I have money

276
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,212
I'm a staff, I hardly earn anything

277
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:48,912
So?

278
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,218
I can't even pay my mom's hospital fees

279
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:52,814
So?

280
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,324
I told her I didn't have any money

281
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,224
I didn't kill her. Why would I do that?

282
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,923
- Then why did you lie?
- I didn't lie

283
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,624
You lied from the beginning

284
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,827
You weren't close to her
You went home after the club

285
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,233
You must have something to hide

286
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,636
- Detective Ha
- Yes?

287
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,233
I'll get an arrest warrant,
write up a report

288
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,334
Yes, sir

289
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:24,346
You hopeless fool
I feel sorry for your parents

290
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,752
They pay to send you to university

291
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,955
All you do is hook up
with girls and go to clubs

292
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,258
Stop putting words in my mouth

293
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,062
- Am I making you angry?
- Stop it!

294
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,962
How old are you anyway?
How old are you?

295
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,769
Sit back down. We're not done yet

296
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,570
I have to pee!

297
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,578
- Mama boys like you...
- Don't call me that!

298
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,580
The mama boy knows how to talk

299
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,276
She's pretty so I took some photos

300
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Why don't you trust me?

301
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,888
Because you're a pervert, a stalker

302
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,583
Don't trust me then

303
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,796
I did it I killed Yeong-ae

304
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,696
I killed her.
Is that what you want to hear?

305
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,294
You're just a kid... already...
Looking for women...

306
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,704
- Think of... your future
- Stop it!

307
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,510
What do you think you're doing!

308
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,308
Don't!

309
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,915
- Hurry up!
- Get them!

310
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,625
Boys shouldn't come in here

311
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
I'm not a boy!

312
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,130
You stay right there

313
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,639
Detective Ha, what happened?

314
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,545
Sorry, he knocked me out

315
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,448
- Hurry and find them
- Yes, sir

316
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,962
That way!

317
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,087
There they are!

318
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,143
You're a genius!

319
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,047
What? You lost them?

320
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,651
- Sorry
- How embarrassing

321
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,753
We didn't expect the kids to...

322
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,562
I should've chosen athletes

323
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,864
At least they can run fast

324
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,565
Congratulations on a job well done

325
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,074
You lost all 3 of them?

326
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,470
Fooled by a bunch of 19 year olds

327
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,178
I'm sorry

328
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:15,276
Did you forcefully accuse
them of being criminals?

329
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,981
Kids these days aren't scared of us

330
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,184
They know juvenile sentences are short

331
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,489
- Kids like that deserve...
- Detective Kim

332
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,601
Stop it, please!

333
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,825
If you're on my side, you could
end up getting fired too

334
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm not taking sides

335
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,926
I just want to catch our criminal

336
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,638
What's wrong?

337
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:15,045
Tell us the truth
The police said you confessed

338
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,239
- I didn't do it
- Then who?

339
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,845
The police said he killed Yeong-ae

340
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,753
- I didn't do it, it's not me
- Then why did you confess?

341
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,354
- It's not me
- He didn't kill her

342
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,553
How do you know that?

343
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,153
- Did you kill her?
- No!

344
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,567
Look how pathetic he is

345
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,367
Do you think he could kill someone?

346
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,075
No.

347
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,886
What do we do now?

348
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,988
We escaped, but what do we do now?

349
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,188
They'll think we ran
because we're guilty

350
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,797
We didn't just run.
We attacked the officers too

351
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,204
It's all a big mess, I'm going home

352
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,208
Have you lost your mind?
The police will be there by now

353
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,109
I'm more scared of my parents
than going to jail

354
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:25,911
What?

355
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:31,421
That's stupid You're weird

356
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,427
You don't know my parents

357
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,134
Staring at the door
isn't going to open it

358
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,335
Let's just go

359
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,434
What did they say?

360
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,948
They refuse to meet us unless
we come with their lawyer

361
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,345
Did you tell them their son
confessed and ran away?

362
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,355
They already knew
The chief called them himself

363
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:12,157
You're lucky your parents are rich

364
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,061
Your dad's a millionaire?
You're going to inherit everything?

365
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:22,368
No...right now I'm repeating
to go to university

366
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,964
There's nothing wrong with that

367
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,373
You need money to study like that

368
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:29,072
Better than going to
a bad school like me

369
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,378
My parents are always
telling me to repeat

370
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,886
My son? Jeong-hun?

371
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,682
Calm down

372
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,986
My son murdered someone?

373
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,291
We need to investigate further

374
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,199
Do you know where he might have gone?

375
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,497
I'm not sure what you mean...

376
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,902
A friend's place or somewhere
he often visited

377
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:59,501
I'm always busy at work...
Can you think of somewhere?

378
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:05,709
I'm not sure... Hyangja, do you know?

379
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,717
You all have no idea?

380
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,830
She just took her medicine

381
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,235
Cervical Cancer

382
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,738
Is it serious?

383
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,738
How long does she have left?

384
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,542
She doesn't have much time left

385
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,443
- How long has she been here?
- A little over 6 months

386
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,346
Her daughter quit school and works

387
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,446
at a hairdresser's to pay for her mom

388
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,048
Her ex-husband has never visited

389
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,957
Her daughter's a little rude,
but she seems all right

390
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,761
You're my hero

391
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,465
- You're such a good daughter
- Forget it

392
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,975
You should've seen the detective
make fun of me for being a staff

393
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,477
- I'm still so mad!
- Same here

394
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,974
He doesn't even know what humanities

395
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,279
and cultural studies is...

396
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,579
Said I'm wasting my parents' money

397
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,383
Same here He kept calling me a mama boy

398
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,787
I was so angry

399
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,294
Right! Going back to
the police is a stupid idea

400
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,988
- I agree
- I think so too

401
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,096
I'm going to ask one last time

402
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,803
You really didn't kill Yeong-ae?

403
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,401
Of course I didn't!
I was just a customer there

404
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,807
She's got nothing to do with me

405
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,311
I don't even remember her face

406
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,614
- You?
- I didn't kill her

407
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,314
She just called me to borrow money

408
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,823
What about you then?

409
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,827
We worked at the internet cafe

410
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,332
We had dinner once, last night

411
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,628
That's it!

412
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,033
Nothing happened between us

413
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,431
I swear it

414
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,833
All right

415
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,444
I trust you both

416
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,045
I trust you too

417
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,845
Same here

418
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,150
Turn your phones off

419
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,657
Before they track us down

420
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,863
Then it's time for us...

421
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,563
To escape

422
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,205
Hey

423
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,513
We're all the same age, 19

424
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,211
Yes, so we are

425
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,318
Why do you keep speaking politely?

426
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,913
I'm...

427
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,324
Is it because you're rich?

428
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,325
- Think you're a prince?
- Don't be mean

429
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,922
It's... just a habit

430
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:48,234
Just speak to us like we're friends

431
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,238
Let's introduce ourselves properly

432
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,338
- What are your names? I'm...
- Wait a minute

433
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,940
We don't need to know your name

434
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,546
Name, age, school, where you live...

435
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,250
People always ask but it's meaningless

436
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,556
Won't it be more fun if we don't know?

437
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:18,467
- Fine I'm age 19, number 1
- Then I'm number 2

438
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,965
- Then I will be number 13
- Why skip to number 13?

439
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,669
I just feel like it

440
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,780
- I told you to go home
- I know, but...

441
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,678
Study for your administration exam

442
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,383
You're wasting time here

443
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,982
You'll just get beaten up by hooligans

444
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,291
Orjust a bunch of 19 year olds

445
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,696
- Watch it!
- It's all right, go home

446
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,096
Seonmin, go buy me some socks

447
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,400
What color socks should I buy?

448
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,599
Black, it's always black

449
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,504
Yes

450
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,509
I'll see you later

451
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,312
Hey! That hurt!

452
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,221
They seem like good kids

453
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,816
Detectives don't need warm hearts

454
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,020
No, I mean those kids
we brought in

455
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,428
I feel sorry for the girl

456
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,025
- So what?
- Excuse me?

457
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,037
Her mom's sick so it's all right
for her to kill someone?

458
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,635
Their families don't care about
them so it's okay to kill?

459
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:31,834
That's not what I meant

460
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,036
You don't need to feel sorry for them

461
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,050
Yes, sir

462
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,363
Can I ask you something?

463
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,560
Why do you hate teenagers so much?

464
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,268
You're strict on juveniles,

465
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,368
- even today
- I don't like them

466
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,470
I don't like kids like them

467
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,880
Hey! Leave her alone!

468
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,081
Stop it! Don't! Leave her alone!

469
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,298
Hey! Leave her alone!

470
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,298
Sin!

471
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,131
This stop is Mokpo, Mokpo station

472
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,277
Where are we? The air's so fresh

473
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,587
I wanted to come to a place like this
after I become a freshman

474
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,887
I wanted to come with my boyfriend

475
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,187
In your dreams!

476
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,899
One person should look after the money

477
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,600
You do it, you're rich

478
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:22,305
No, you do it
Your father works at a bank

479
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,406
I'm not good handling money

480
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,212
I get sick looking at numbers

481
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,913
- Your order's ready
- Great! Ddeokbokki!

482
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,819
You're lucky to be rich.
You can buy whatever you want

483
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,731
Yes...but I don't really need anything

484
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,232
You don't need anything?

485
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,433
She gave us a lot

486
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:13,358
- Hey! Slow down
- Have some water

487
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,669
I didn't know Ddeokbokki
was so delicious!

488
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,774
You've never tried it?

489
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:30,075
My mom said it's junk food...
She told me not to eat it

490
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,375
You're joking

491
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,780
You do everything
your mom says?

492
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,786
Because I'm repeating...

493
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,788
Right now, you're a fugitive...

494
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,388
You're on the run Do whatever you want

495
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,799
What else haven't you done before?

496
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,702
You play, I don't want to...

497
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:20,827
Did you see that?

498
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,655
What?

499
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,461
We spent it... we went around a lot

500
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,365
I don't believe this.

501
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,869
You're supposed to be our Treasurer

502
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,461
Stop it

503
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,973
We don't know how long we'll run

504
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,976
You should've been more careful
with our spendings

505
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,569
- We all spent it together
- You should've stopped him

506
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:10,579
Don't blame me!

507
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,583
You bought those sunglasses

508
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,989
I'm sorry, it's my fault
But I have a credit card

509
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,489
We can't use a credit card!

510
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,584
Don't shout. This is your fault too

511
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,395
Stay out of this

512
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,599
Let the men handle it

513
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,101
- Stop it, you ugly...
- Ugly what?

514
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,800
What do I look like?

515
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,208
Come back here! Move!
What did you say to me?

516
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,610
- You tiny little dwarf
- What? Dwarf?

517
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:01,531
I'm sorry, I was the Treasurer

518
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,424
This is all my fault

519
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,130
It's not

520
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,829
It's not your fault, don't worry

521
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,638
Do we have to have money?

522
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:16,544
Of course we need somewhere
to sleep at night

523
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,639
Can't we just go to a hotel

524
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,048
and send them the money later?

525
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,057
This is the internet cafe...

526
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,468
Hi! Jeong-hun!

527
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,665
Are you all right?

528
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,676
Yes, that's right... In Gangwon province

529
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,473
My parents don't know yet

530
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,582
You will?

531
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,987
Thanks, boss

532
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,787
See you

533
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,496
Are you sure we can trust him?

534
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,901
We can trust him, he knows Yeong-ae too

535
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,302
That's good... but do you think...

536
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,203
It's fine, don't worry

537
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,507
What I mean is...

538
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,114
Mr. Park, I need to ask about your son

539
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:29,016
You took him to the station...

540
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,812
Did you have an arrest warrant?

541
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,921
Taking someone without a warrant

542
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,830
Questioning by force.
Isn't that illegal?

543
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,832
That's right

544
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,927
Conducting an investigation
without court consent...

545
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,234
This is your son's camera

546
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,743
He visited the internet cafe everyday

547
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,245
He took photos of her in hiding

548
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,541
Take a look for yourself

549
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,546
- Your point being...?
- He was stalking her

550
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,550
And that makes him a criminal?

551
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,648
He ran while being investigated

552
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,955
Of course we're suspicious of him

553
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,551
Those photos...

554
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,757
Do you have any proof
that my son took them?

555
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,176
Jeong-hun!

556
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,388
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay

557
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,981
I heard you ran from the police

558
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,287
They came to see me

559
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,695
It just sort of happened...
but we're innocent

560
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,795
We're going to stay on the run
until they find the real murderer

561
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,299
Are they your friends?

562
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,905
Boss

563
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,405
- You believe me, right?
- Of course I believe you

564
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,916
Yeong-ae and I weren't even close

565
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,215
Why would I kill her?

566
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:17,320
Yes... I know that. This is unfortunate

567
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,422
It's not fair...
The police won't even listen

568
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,933
It's just a case of bad luck

569
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,837
The truth will be revealed

570
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,741
- Don't worry about it
- Thank you

571
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,241
It's not much

572
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,447
How can I thank you?

573
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,856
There's no need for that

574
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:56,963
I should get back to Seoul
before the police visit again

575
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,664
Take care of yourselves
Stay here tonight

576
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,763
Thanks, boss

577
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,968
Cheers!

578
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,376
I needed a good drink

579
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,384
You eat a lot for your size

580
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,082
Now that we're full... what's next?

581
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,684
We have no plans. Just go with the flow

582
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,993
Let's stay here tonight, and tomorrow...

583
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,492
What do we do tomorrow?

584
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,398
It's not good to stay
in one place too long

585
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,303
That's the first rule for runaways
Keep moving

586
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,307
- Where should we go?
- How about the beach?

587
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,502
Good idea! I haven't been in ages

588
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,307
- I've never been
- You're joking!

589
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,904
- I'm not
- Are you Mongolian?

590
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,418
All Koreans have been to
the beach at least once

591
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:55,120
You both think everyone's like you

592
00:44:56,293 --> 00:45:01,026
Never been to the beach
Never owned an MP3 player

593
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,931
Can't even eat 3 meals a day
There are a lot of kids like that

594
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,833
You can't even imagine it, right?

595
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,239
Let's go to the beach then

596
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,045
What else? What do you want to do?

597
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:26,253
Go to sea, get on a boat...
Pose like the scene in 'Titanic'

598
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,357
I have no thoughts about my life

599
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:34,261
You must have plans for the future

600
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,265
I have no plans at all

601
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,860
You're only 19. You have no dreams?

602
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:47,275
Dreams...? I don't know
Number 13, do you?

603
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,173
I have so many plans

604
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,081
English at 10am, math at 12:30pm

605
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,086
then TOEFL in the evening
University,

606
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:01,591
study abroad then get my MBA and...

607
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,984
You're giving me a headache

608
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,188
Tell us what your dreams are

609
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,994
Well... I want to go to sea

610
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,399
You haven't been to sea as well?
You haven't been on a boat?

611
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:16,098
I've been on a cruise, on a big ship

612
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,902
Then why do you want to go to sea?

613
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,599
To go fishing?

614
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,908
No I want to...

615
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,511
Do this too

616
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:37,324
Hey! Number 13! You're naughty!

617
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,022
What about it? I don't get it

618
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,131
What is it?

619
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:15,255
- It's a rap battle!
- They're all pretty good

620
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,571
Okay, stop there How was it?
Did you enjoy it?

621
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,575
Yes!

622
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,874
- Are you all having fun?
- Yes!

623
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,283
Who will be our winner?

624
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,979
If you liked this person, clap now!

625
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,886
Should I call for back-up?

626
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,689
Why don't we just bring in a SWAT
team to take out 3 kids?

627
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,895
$1,000 is up for grabs!

628
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,603
You rapped before, you're good

629
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,508
I'm not good

630
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,912
Here! My friend's going!

631
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,211
We have a challenger,

632
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,912
- give him a clap
- Hurry up, go

633
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,319
Come on out!

634
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:28,028
Go back study, get out of here

635
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,733
Go to your parents, ask for money

636
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:34,341
Get out, get out yeah

637
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:40,350
come on~ come on~

638
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,953
Close your mouth, watch your words

639
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,652
You stand here but you're nothing

640
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,354
Listen up, listen carefully

641
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,159
You rap just like a broken car

642
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,462
Listen up, listen to my rap

643
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:01,163
I don't know you, your broken dreams

644
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:07,177
I don't know where I'm headed

645
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,180
Don't think you know me, you don't

646
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:16,982
Look at your expressions now

647
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,186
Big Bang, I've got what it takes

648
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,287
This mic, this stage is all mine

649
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,798
Don't make fun of me, it's not new

650
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,494
Try to make me cry if you can

651
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,197
Come on, is this the best you can do?

652
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,797
You'll regret having challenged me

653
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,809
Everybody tries to imitate me

654
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,402
I'm upset, I'm unhappy, bang bang

655
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,213
Worship my brother, my parents...

656
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,415
Why did he stop?

657
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,027
It's them!

658
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,327
- Isn't that them?
- I think you're right

659
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,835
- Let's go!
- Hurry up, go

660
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,162
How long will you keep running?

661
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,661
If you're innocent, come out!
Come out and tell us

662
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,672
What happened the day Yeong-ae died

663
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,068
Tell me why you took photos of her

664
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,080
Why did you stalk her?

665
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:53,875
Listen up

666
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:02,185
I'm going to get you kids
I don't care what it takes

667
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,598
Tell us the truth

668
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,503
About Yeong-ae's photos, stalking her

669
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,909
He was talking to you

670
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,512
Tell us

671
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,914
Don't talk like that... you're not a cop

672
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,526
I'm sorry.

673
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,926
What are you sorry about?

674
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,833
The truth is... I watched her secretly

675
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,331
- Why would you do that?
- She was so pretty...

676
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:55,435
but I couldn't talk to her

677
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,343
I didn't mean any harm

678
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,746
What you did is harmful

679
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,340
That's what stalkers and perverts do

680
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,750
Don't be so harsh on him

681
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,151
Aren't you angry?

682
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,656
He's been lying all this time

683
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,158
She's got nothing to do with me

684
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,353
I don't even remember her face

685
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,261
You don't remember her face?

686
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,858
I actually believed you

687
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,968
- I'm sorry
- Stop pretending

688
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,269
Acting helpless, as though
you know nothing

689
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,175
- What I mean is...
- Don't say anything

690
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:32,272
I can't trust you. Did you kill her?

691
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,477
- What?
- Stop it, that's enough

692
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,834
Are you all right? Where are you now?

693
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:32,536
We're fine, heading towards Sokcho

694
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:41,345
Am I doing the right thing?

695
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,248
You should cooperate with the police

696
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,347
Please promise me one thing

697
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,755
What is it?

698
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:53,558
They may be criminals,
but they're good kids

699
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,861
Please don't harm them

700
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,962
Don't worry about that

701
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,271
Let's go

702
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,773
Good bye

703
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,772
I've divided the money up evenly

704
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,475
Let's split up now

705
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:21,288
- Do we have to?
- Yes, I've had enough

706
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,883
You wanted to run away together

707
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,485
I changed my mind, I'll travel alone

708
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,394
We're not going on a boat?

709
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,300
Why don't the 2 of you go?

710
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,995
You look good together anyway

711
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,297
What are you going on about?

712
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,898
I don't know your names,

713
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,909
I'll probably never see you again

714
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:41,807
Have a good life then

715
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,810
He's so stupid

716
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,818
I'm sorry

717
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,521
Stop saying you're sorry

718
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,926
I should have told the truth

719
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:05,031
I didn't think you would believe me

720
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,336
- I'm really sorry
- Stop saying that!

721
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,033
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

722
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,631
How many times have you said that?

723
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,744
Sorry Oh, sorry... oops

724
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,440
I'm going too

725
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,647
A girl I know died

726
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,553
I've been mucking around like this

727
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,352
I wasn't thinking straight

728
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:30,756
I'm going

729
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,997
I am thinking about the future

730
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,796
Not hard enough

731
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,497
You've started on the path to failure

732
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,598
Find a way to make up for it

733
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,906
They pay to send you to
school and you skip classes

734
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:26,415
You go to clubs, hook up with girls

735
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,609
How old are you?

736
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,940
Is something wrong? Tell me!

737
00:56:55,912 --> 00:57:00,042
I'm asking you out on a date
I liked you from the beginning

738
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,547
You have to protect me...

739
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,453
promise

740
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,250
You promised to protect me

741
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,788
You didn't come with your parents?

742
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,193
No.

743
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,099
Please don't tell them I came

744
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,796
As you wish

745
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,634
Hello? Hello?

746
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:31,833
It's you! Min-seo! Are you all right?

747
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,333
Where are you now?

748
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,546
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine, Mom

749
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,749
Is father angry with me?

750
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:50,751
He's worried sick about you...
Are you sure you're not hurt?

751
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:56,558
Listen to me carefully

752
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,561
You can't come home,
don't even come near here

753
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:05,574
If the press finds out,
it will be a huge mess

754
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,578
Our lawyer will handle things
You just do as you're told

755
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,375
Let me speak to him

756
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,975
He'll call you soon, hang up now

757
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,577
Don't hang up, let me speak...

758
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,380
Do you understand me?

759
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:25,393
- Give me the phone
- Stay out of this

760
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,587
Hello...?

761
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:42,411
You're busy, don't worry about me

762
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,714
Working on the weekends,
I hope they're paying you well

763
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:52,619
Everyone wants me to do their hair

764
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,823
Your daughter?

765
00:59:55,892 --> 01:00:00,226
It's all right... I'm eating well

766
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:06,428
I even ate a whole banana yesterday

767
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,240
Don't worry about me, work hard

768
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,137
Thanks mom

769
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:22,951
I'll visit soon and bring you treats

770
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,948
Sorry, I have to go now

771
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:03,385
- Hello...mom? Hello?
- Come in number 13, over

772
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,697
Number 1 ! where are you?
What are you doing?

773
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,699
I came out to the beach for a walk

774
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:16,204
In my pocket... I found your MP3 player

775
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,802
I don't want you to report me as a thief

776
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,105
Come get your stuff

777
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,311
Here? The beach...

778
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,713
I don't really know where

779
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,112
Tell me where you are

780
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,558
Hurry up!

781
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,970
We're fugitives now

782
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,874
It's dangerous sitting out like that

783
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:29,775
I'm sorry

784
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,071
- Here, it's yours
- Thank you

785
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:33,877
It's all right

786
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,187
Where's number 2? In her room?

787
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:44,490
Were you... in the same room?

788
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,297
We split up just after you left

789
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,596
Why? You like her

790
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:57,503
What..? I don't like her

791
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,803
I left you alone on purpose

792
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,007
I mean it

793
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,403
You're the one who likes her

794
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,310
Me?

795
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,814
Me? Like her?

796
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,510
Don't say that!

797
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,420
She's not even a girl

798
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,916
She's not my type, you can have her

799
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,822
She's not my type either

800
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,933
I think she hurt her ankle

801
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:35,137
She sprained it last night
It was swollen this morning

802
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,642
She was limping around before

803
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,850
Do you know where she is?

804
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,646
I think she'll still be around

805
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,352
Probably, her ankle's sore...

806
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,469
Let me go!

807
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,882
Don't touch me!

808
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,477
It's her!

809
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,384
Let me go!

810
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,986
How about a glass of soju?

811
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,385
We're on duty

812
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:16,195
Your necklace... isn't it for women?

813
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,700
You must have strange taste

814
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,213
It belonged to my wife

815
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,515
I proposed to her with this

816
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,823
I never bought her a proper gift

817
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:42,622
Your wife was beaten by teenagers...

818
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:50,738
Do you think it's silly that I'm
chasing after those kids?

819
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,137
Of course not

820
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,335
You probably think I'm trying
to get my revenge

821
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,741
I don't think that

822
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,744
- Don't lie to me
- I'm not

823
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,141
- Have you finished?
- Yes

824
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:05,050
It's a small town.

825
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:09,455
We'll find them in internet cafes,
saunas in no time

826
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,052
We're going to search
for them all night?

827
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:15,256
We're not here to relax at the beach

828
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,665
The stars look like they'll fall down

829
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:26,172
They feel so much closer than in Seoul

830
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,378
I wanted to be an astronomer
when I was young

831
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,073
I wanted to be an astronaut

832
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:39,384
We had a lot of dreams
when we were young, right?

833
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:43,084
I used to look at the stars more often

834
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:49,291
Sky, universe, stars

835
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:54,098
Sea, wind, trees, grass

836
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,901
What are you doing? What's he up to?

837
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,702
Leave him, he's listening to music...

838
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,801
Look! Did you see it?

839
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,904
Sure... a shooting star

840
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,314
Number 13, did you see?
What are you doing?

841
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,114
- What are you listening to?
- Why? what happened?

842
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,121
A shooting star. You didn't see it?

843
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,316
What are you listening to?

844
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,425
- It's a song I made
- You wrote it?

845
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,621
You write songs? Let me listen

846
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,630
You're such a mystery

847
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,825
I can't hear... what is it?

848
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,834
It's just the instrumental track

849
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:29,530
- Sing it for us
- Let's listen to it live

850
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,335
- It's not very good
- Come on, let us hear it

851
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,741
- It's not finished yet
- Sing it! Please?

852
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:51,458
Are you all right, is everything okay

853
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:58,160
You left without a trace...

854
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:04,173
to another world

855
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:13,177
After time passes and I'm born again

856
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:19,779
I'll tell you that I love you first

857
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:25,293
All the things I wanted to say

858
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:34,599
I'll confess my love to you

859
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:41,200
The one person that I've loved

860
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:47,512
If we're able to meet tomorrow

861
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:53,317
Greet me with a smile

862
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:59,521
Tell me you've been well

863
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:06,228
You're the only one for me

864
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:11,638
I miss you so much

865
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,835
I'm brave enough to tell you now

866
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:20,246
I've always wanted to say this

867
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:26,653
I love you

868
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,356
We had a bad run

869
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,563
Nothing serious, but she's hurt

870
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,570
It's not broken, but it hurts

871
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,773
Sure. An X-ray would help

872
01:10:53,549 --> 01:11:00,478
I don't think I can go there...
I'll send someone else

873
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,888
Can you tell me where you are?

874
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:04,887
Let me get a pen

875
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,593
You're at a temple

876
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:15,002
I know where it is

877
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,518
Sorry to interrupt you both

878
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,918
Don't overreact.

879
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,718
He was tying his handkerchief
around my ankle

880
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:40,522
You carry a handkerchief?
You're so weird

881
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,630
Here, for your ankle

882
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,532
I could do it myself

883
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:55,338
Just say thanks, be cute
Guys like cute girls

884
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,345
I know I'm not cute

885
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:03,150
- No, you're really cute
- Don't say that out of pity

886
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,048
I mean it

887
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,953
Look at you throwing
pick-up lines at her

888
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:11,652
Give me your handkerchief again

889
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,760
I put a patch on it for you

890
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,560
The yellow looks ugly,

891
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,760
plus it won't fall off with
the handkerchief over it

892
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,360
You're going to cover my ugly
patch with his handkerchief?

893
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,770
Stop it Give it to me then

894
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,471
What's this?

895
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,878
- The work of a stalker?
- Give it to me

896
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,982
Don't look at them

897
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:40,784
- It's Yeong-ae
- Let me see...it is her

898
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,888
I'm not a pervert

899
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,392
The photos turned out nice

900
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,589
I was going to give them to her later

901
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,189
I feel sorry for her

902
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:59,805
Actually... I've been hiding something

903
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:07,106
I said I didn't know
why she needed money

904
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,813
She told me when we met

905
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:17,118
I need money to attend acting school

906
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:21,627
I told him I wanted to break up
after I got the part

907
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:25,428
He told me to pay back every cent

908
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,528
Or he'll tell everyone about us

909
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,436
Don't ask me for money

910
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,532
It's your problem, you handle it

911
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,237
I wouldn't ask unless I was desperate

912
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:40,145
Please help me This is
going to be my big break

913
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,945
It's my dream! I want to achieve it

914
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,043
They're your dreams, not mine

915
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,953
Eun-yeong, please

916
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:53,253
I shouldn't have been so cold

917
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:58,464
It's not your fault
Don't blame yourself

918
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,665
Wait... look at this

919
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,278
I think it's him

920
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:15,078
Isn't this your boss?

921
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,183
What did you say?

922
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:21,279
- Look at this photo
- Show me... it is him!

923
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,288
I didn't notice before

924
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,486
but he's behind her in
all of these photos

925
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,996
That is his car

926
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,492
Why would she get in his car?

927
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:33,900
Hang on...

928
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,094
He's married

929
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,503
Then the man you
said Yeong-ae...

930
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,202
The married guy!
It can't be...

931
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,611
I just talked to him
on the phone

932
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,009
After he came to the resort...

933
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,212
Right! The detectives came then!

934
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,919
How would they have known unless...

935
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,515
My boss isn't like that!

936
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:33,053
They were here until just now

937
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,358
They can't be far then. Give me the keys

938
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,175
Actually...

939
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,679
I have something to confess

940
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,086
What is it?

941
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,189
I told you there was nothing
between Yeong-ae and me

942
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,390
- We kissed
- What?

943
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:16,597
But nothing else happened

944
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,199
Don't you think it's strange?

945
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,300
Why would she go out with you?

946
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,706
I'm telling the truth
She kissed me first

947
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,119
What's wrong?

948
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,218
You don't believe me?

949
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,818
It's not that...
I think she wanted money from you

950
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,419
I think so too

951
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,132
She kissed me to ask me for money?

952
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,328
And she asked you to protect her

953
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,633
She just wanted money,

954
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:53,641
but guys could get the wrong idea

955
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,939
She didn't say anything about money

956
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,346
You didn't give her the chance,

957
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,043
or she missed the right timing

958
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:05,351
Timing?

959
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:11,658
See you tomorrow!

960
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,665
Forget it, I got tricked

961
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,467
She wasn't all that
great anyway

962
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:24,164
She wasn't? She was great
when you kissed her

963
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,968
But now she's not all that

964
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,169
- That's not what I said
- Do you regret it now?

965
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:33,078
I don't regret it. I've got
nothing to do with her

966
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,274
What about you?

967
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,979
Your friend begged you for money

968
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,078
but you refused... do you regret that?

969
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,886
No, I could've been nicer

970
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:47,690
but it was the right thing
to do in my situation

971
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:49,887
I regret it

972
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:54,702
I took photos secretly and
never spoke to her

973
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:00,498
I don't know what she was like,
what problems she faced

974
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:06,006
If I'd been brave enough to tell
her how pretty she was...

975
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:10,513
Or tell her how much I liked her

976
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,717
It's not really that difficult

977
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:18,720
Of course...

978
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,820
It's unfortunate that she
met men for their money

979
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,734
But she did that to
chase her dream

980
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,537
At least she had
a dream for herself

981
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,541
Me...?

982
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:41,343
I just did as I was told,

983
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,441
I didn't know what I really wanted

984
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,955
I never thought about it

985
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,452
I regret that

986
01:18:56,031 --> 01:19:02,061
I only thought about money...
not about my dreams

987
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:06,467
I'm the worst here

988
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,870
I never thought about anything...

989
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,776
I just wasted time

990
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,077
It's sad

991
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:21,284
We didn't kill her but we didn't
help save her either

992
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,807
We should do something

993
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,815
Let's meet that man
He's the one responsible

994
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,010
He's not like that
He wouldn't kill someone

995
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,814
He told the police where we were

996
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:52,911
You don't know that.

997
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:56,014
They could have tracked our cell phones

998
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:59,117
It happened twice You called
him this morning too

999
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,525
It's just co-incidence

1000
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:03,223
It isn't a co-incidence
Don't you get it?

1001
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,324
- Don't get so worked up
- Aren't you mad?

1002
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,631
He's a dirty man playing
around with a young girl

1003
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,433
- You can't prove that
- Didn't you see the photos?

1004
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,031
We know he threatened Yeong-ae

1005
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,043
He's capable of killing her

1006
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:19,945
My boss wouldn't kill anyone

1007
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,348
He's never acted strange
around her Not even once

1008
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,846
You're here.

1009
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,256
Could you help
Yeong-ae clean up?

1010
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,261
Yeong-ae...
Take this with you

1011
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,262
Yeong-ae was
usually so bright

1012
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:48,669
But...she looked
so sad that day

1013
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,176
It must be him

1014
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:54,181
The police might be waiting there

1015
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,376
If we get caught again

1016
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,282
We have to tell them the truth

1017
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,185
They didn't believe us when
we tried to tell them before

1018
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,107
Stop right there

1019
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,205
There's nowhere for you to run

1020
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:42,426
Stop!

1021
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,927
Don't come any closer, we'll jump

1022
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,331
We mean it, we'll jump

1023
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,925
You don't want us to die, do you?

1024
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:50,631
Come over here, don't be silly

1025
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,229
Jump if you're game enough

1026
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:54,440
Don't say that

1027
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,033
Did you hear what he said?

1028
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,045
He was rude from the moment we met

1029
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,139
- Don't think we won't jump!
- Fine, we'll wait

1030
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,649
Don't take too long to decide

1031
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,547
What if they really jump...

1032
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,144
Trust me, they won't

1033
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,452
- I think I can jump
- What?

1034
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,763
- You mean it?
- Why not? we're 19

1035
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:19,463
I'm game enough

1036
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,770
I don't think they're joking

1037
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,366
Don't fall for their tricks

1038
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,073
Are you going to take responsibility?

1039
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,774
Sure, I'll take the blame

1040
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,078
We'll be together, even in heaven

1041
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,676
I don't want to get fired

1042
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,983
Go on, jump. Do it.

1043
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,795
Wait, don't!

1044
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,805
We'll let you go. We'll let you go

1045
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,399
We're not letting them go

1046
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:20,122
- They left the keys in the car
- Do you have a license?

1047
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:23,721
You can acquire a license
when you're 18 but...

1048
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:27,029
You still need parent
permission to buy a car

1049
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:30,134
We can vote for a member of parliament

1050
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,433
but we can't vote against policies

1051
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:34,634
We're adults but still children
What do people want from us?

1052
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,559
This is all for your own good

1053
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,268
You know I'm on your side, right?

1054
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,790
Welcome

1055
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:30,197
- Is the boss in?
- He's gone out

1056
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:38,896
Follow me

1057
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,112
Hello

1058
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,919
What are you doing here?

1059
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,118
I thought you were
in Gangwon province

1060
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,225
Did you come on your own?

1061
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:03,229
Yeong-ae...

1062
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,132
What?

1063
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:10,437
Did you really go out with her?

1064
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,336
What are you talking about?

1065
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:16,138
Yeong-ae told me
she was seeing a man

1066
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:20,745
I don't believe this
Why do you think it's me?

1067
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,840
She said he was married

1068
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,852
Am I the only married man?
There are thousands of them!

1069
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:31,949
What's this?

1070
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,765
What is all this? So what?

1071
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:44,362
It's nothing! This is nothing.
What is this!

1072
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:05,283
We can print those photos again

1073
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:11,198
I helped you run from the police

1074
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,290
This is how you repay me?

1075
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:16,804
- Why did you do that to her?
- What did I do?

1076
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:21,308
I don't believe this, Jeong-hun
How could you accuse me?

1077
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:27,815
You pay me back every last cent
of the money I gave you

1078
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,213
You got that?

1079
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:32,219
Yeong-ae told me
That man...

1080
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:39,727
That married man told her
To pay back every last cent

1081
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,523
Exactly what you just said

1082
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,927
I really looked up to you

1083
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:52,236
No-one favored me at home or at school

1084
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,036
But I worked hard for you

1085
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:02,039
You trusted me... I was grateful

1086
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:08,050
Why did you do it?

1087
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,348
Tell me

1088
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,252
Tell me the truth

1089
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,674
I never forced her to see me

1090
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:35,478
I was just joking around
I asked her on a date

1091
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,281
She said she would
go out with me

1092
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,584
if I paid for her acting classes

1093
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,386
I have a family

1094
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:49,589
It started off as a fling

1095
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:53,698
But the more I met her...

1096
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:59,401
I ended up falling for her

1097
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:04,411
- Then why did you kill her?
- I didn't kill her!

1098
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,627
It's late, you didn't answer my calls

1099
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:34,837
Is something wrong?

1100
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,643
Tell me what's wrong

1101
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:44,650
I don't want to see you anymore

1102
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,951
- This isn't right, I'm sorry
- We've been through this

1103
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:56,756
Thank you for helping me out

1104
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,561
- What?
- I'm sorry

1105
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:06,466
Fine, pay me back my money then

1106
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:11,169
Every last cent of my money

1107
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,982
I'll pay once I start earning money

1108
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,780
- Pay me right now!
- I don't have it

1109
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,687
I'll pay you when I can
You're so stingy

1110
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:34,200
Yeong-ae, don't leave me, I like you

1111
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:38,102
Get off me, let me go

1112
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,807
Wait! Yeong-ae!

1113
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,100
What are you doing?

1114
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,514
Be careful!

1115
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,710
- Let go
- Listen to me, please

1116
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,117
- Let go!
- Yeong-ae!

1117
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:55,815
Get off me! Let me go!

1118
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:02,126
Yeong-ae!

1119
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:03,727
Yeong-ae!

1120
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:16,436
It was an accident

1121
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:18,141
You killed her

1122
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,646
No! I didn't mean to kill her

1123
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,240
Stop making excuses!

1124
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:26,650
You destroyed her dreams

1125
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:27,745
- You ruined her
- It's not my fault

1126
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,552
- You took her life
- I didn't

1127
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:34,057
Stop

1128
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,060
Stop it

1129
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:40,459
That's enough

1130
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,793
You need to come to the station too

1131
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,489
Why? You've got your criminal

1132
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:11,998
We haven't done anything wrong

1133
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:16,894
Running off during investigation
is intrusion of public duty

1134
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,905
Jumping off the roof

1135
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:20,998
was intrusion of public
order and blackmail

1136
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:25,007
You stole my car

1137
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,904
Do you even have a license?

1138
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:31,317
Driving without a license too

1139
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:39,026
And so ourjourney ended

1140
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:46,924
The dead were silent
and so were we

1141
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:49,630
The heartless city...

1142
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:54,241
only the city lights quivered
silently in the darkness

1143
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:09,147
I met Yeong-ae in my dreams that night

1144
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:42,583
I'm sorry

1145
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:45,390
For what?

1146
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:50,388
For kissing you even though
I didn't really like you

1147
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:57,595
You're nice and good to girls

1148
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:02,008
I thought you would help me

1149
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:08,206
I'm sorry I couldn't help you

1150
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:10,716
It's not your fault

1151
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:14,814
I shouldn't have approached you

1152
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:20,221
Were you mad at me?

1153
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:22,623
It's all right...

1154
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:31,634
I actually enjoyed the kiss

1155
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:35,641
Did you?

1156
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:42,139
Goodbye

1157
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:44,808
Please forgive me

1158
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:51,112
Are you going
to forgive me?

1159
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:00,719
I said I was sorry, forgive me...

1160
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:04,230
Go buy me a pair of socks

1161
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,432
Sure thing

1162
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,434
White ones? Black ones?

1163
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:12,930
- Here
- I'll get the black ones

1164
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:26,245
I've lived a hard life, you know that

1165
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:32,256
That's why I hated kids
who think life is easy

1166
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:24,305
Can I take a shower?

1167
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:26,403
Me too. I need to wash my hair

1168
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,412
When's our trial?

1169
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:31,417
Trial? why would you go to trial?

1170
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,620
- Get out of here
- What?

1171
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:41,020
Breathe in the fresh air!

1172
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:44,622
It feels like we got back
from a long trip

1173
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,428
I don't want to go home but

1174
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:50,536
Are you scared? Mama boy

1175
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:53,938
- Don't call me that
- Are you a big boy now?

1176
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,533
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, hello

1177
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:59,841
Don't look so happy
we let you go

1178
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:01,438
What you did was wrong

1179
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:07,650
We're so busy that we don't
have time to waste on you

1180
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,849
- Excuse me?
- Anyway, thank you

1181
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:14,361
You tried to find out the truth...

1182
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,463
It was quite brave of you

1183
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:18,555
Thank you

1184
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:20,862
What happened was unfortunate

1185
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:23,466
But think of it as good experience

1186
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:28,370
It will end up being...
what's the word...?

1187
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:29,374
Beneficial?

1188
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:36,383
An ironic fate? That's not it either

1189
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:39,180
- Take care of yourselves
- Goodbye

1190
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:45,887
I almost forgot to tell you this

1191
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:50,286
I was 19 once too

1192
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:57,898
Nineteen

1193
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,407
Like the warm summer sunlight...

1194
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:05,302
The age of nineteen won't last

1195
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:09,511
There's nothing. We can do to stop time

1196
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:10,515
Let's go

1197
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:15,922
We need to find new direction

1198
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,219
and follow the light to our futures

1199
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:21,927
I didn't tell you before

1200
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:25,931
My name's Cha Eun-yeong

1201
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:30,229
I'm Seo Jeong-hun

1202
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:35,940
I'm Park Min-seo... I'm 19 years old

1203
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,200
Subrip: easytobeaman

1204
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:45,151
I had a crazy dream one of a kind

1205
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:47,653
It rained in my dream

1206
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:49,655
The sun's so hot out here,

1207
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:52,351
but it's hotter on the other side

1208
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,656
Will tomorrow come? Ready or not

1209
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:57,356
My dream's to be born to a writer

1210
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:00,264
Whoever is weak can be
strong by working out

1211
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:02,666
Beef up your soul with visuals

1212
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:04,966
Drive, keep watching the side mirror

1213
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,667
I'm always wandering around
with my big eyes, I'm an animal

1214
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:10,073
Sometimes I've wasted my youth

1215
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:12,476
I've leant on you, I'm sorry

1216
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:17,381
Sometimes things come back to me

1217
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,681
The streets are empty,

1218
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:22,381
I want to be like those
couples walking around

1219
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:27,985
I don't want to be alone
The nights are lonely

1220
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:32,499
Today, tomorrow I'm all alone
I'm wiping my tears

1221
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:38,004
Shine the light on my childhood dream

1222
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:42,008
Back then, I sat splashing
along the water

1223
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:44,408
I don't know how I'll end up

1224
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:47,003
I have nowhere to wish

1225
01:39:47,081 --> 01:39:52,018
Nowhere to turn to
I'll regret this someday

1226
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:54,418
I don't know how I'll end up

1227
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:57,013
I have nowhere to wish

1228
01:39:57,091 --> 01:40:02,222
Nowhere to turn to
I'll regret this someday

1229
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:07,427
Let's go higher than TOP

1230
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,834
Standing in this endless tunnel
This is enough for me

1231
01:40:10,904 --> 01:40:12,531
Holding my gaze, family

1232
01:40:12,606 --> 01:40:17,043
I have my family, friends
I've got everything I need

1233
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:20,239
If they don't understand

1234
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:22,339
I close my mouth and walk on

1235
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,850
I'm a burden on myself

1236
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:27,751
I don't know the solution

1237
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:30,153
People always asking, it hurts

1238
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:32,454
Makes me lose confidence
and hurts my heart

1239
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:37,361
Sometimes things come back to me

1240
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:39,661
The streets are empty,

1241
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,361
I want to be like those
couples walking around

1242
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:47,772
I don't want to be alone
The nights are lonely

1243
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:52,574
Today, tomorrow I'm all alone
I'm wiping my tears

1244
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:57,879
Shine the light on my childhood dream

1245
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:02,479
Back then, I sat splashing
along the water

1246
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:07,789
Why, I don't know why but I feel lost

1247
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:10,887
I'm still wandering Today and tomorrow

1248
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:12,693
Because of me

1249
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:18,102
I still have time left
I'm grateful for time

1250
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:22,404
I'll work things out for me

1251
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:27,914
I don't want to be alone
The nights are lonely

1252
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:32,509
Today, tomorrow I'm all alone
I'm wiping my tears

1253
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:37,819
Shine the light on my childhood dream

1254
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:41,918
Back then, I sat splashing
along the water

1255
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:44,429
I don't know how I'll end up

1256
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:46,830
I have nowhere to wish

1257
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:51,928
Nowhere to turn to
I'll regret this someday

1258
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:54,439
I don't know how I'll end up

1259
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,840
I have nowhere to wish

1260
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:02,143
Nowhere to turn to
I'll regret this someday
