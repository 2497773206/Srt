1
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,195
Quick. Follow me!

2
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:34,151
Kill him!

3
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,753
Archers. Cover us!

4
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,949
Yes. Sir! The rest. Follow me

5
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,717
Kill!

6
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,195
I'll kill you all!

7
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,073
Son of a bitch

8
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,997
I'll kill you

9
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,192
Son of a bitch

10
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,113
Your Highness. Are you alright?

11
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,118
Su, let's get out of here!

12
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,038
Ma, stay behind. Yuan, come with me

13
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,598
Yes. Sir!

14
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,596
You bastard!

15
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,391
Son of a bitch

16
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,075
Bastard!

17
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,752
Son of a bitch

18
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,275
Ma!

19
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,356
Yuan, please take the Prince to safety

20
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,875
Su!

21
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,836
Go!

22
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,397
Your Highness

23
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm afraid Su has perished

24
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,670
Dead? Are you sure?

25
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,356
T ake an elite team to find General Su

26
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,039
Dead or alive. I want him here!

27
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,589
Yes, sir

28
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,158
Su is back!

29
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,312
Soldiers. T ake him to the doctor

30
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,111
Yes. Sir

31
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,077
My dear brother

32
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,956
Your Highness. Colonel Ma and I are back

33
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,879
Su. You've been exemplary

34
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,110
Have a seat

35
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,237
Thank you

36
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,237
Su

37
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,998
You saved my life

38
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,237
I'll ask the Emperor...

39
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,395
...to make you Governor of Hubei

40
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,079
I am grateful for your consideration

41
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,717
But I cannot claim all the credit

42
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,758
Yuan is more capable

43
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,954
I know Yuan is your foster brother...

44
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,792
...and the blood brother of your wife

45
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,189
But he is too reckless

46
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,391
You need to control Yuan

47
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,959
I hope you'll accept

48
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,275
Comrades!

49
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,714
General Su led us to countless victories

50
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,788
Enemies have fallen under his sword

51
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,073
Let's toast our triumphs!

52
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,797
Cheers!

53
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,712
Ma. This is for you

54
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,596
I can't accept!

55
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,157
A great sword deserves a great warrior! You
don't like it?

56
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,837
No

57
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,155
Of course, I do

58
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,196
Then it's yours

59
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,912
Thank you

60
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,837
Put it to good use

61
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,156
Yes! I promise

62
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,433
Why aren't you drinking?

63
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,030
A warrior should watch his drinking

64
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,312
A sip with our victory is OK

65
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,914
I'll ask them to come drink with you

66
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,713
With you here, I am not needed

67
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,359
You're my brother. They'll respect you

68
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,792
You must take care of the troops when I'm
gone

69
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,237
Why is it?

70
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,153
T aking the promotion so soon. Your Honor?

71
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,270
Nonsense!

72
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,112
I've decided to go home

73
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,749
What? You just won a big battle

74
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,108
This is your time. Don't walk away

75
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,396
My mind's made up. I leave tomorrow

76
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,468
Honestly, you're more suited for battles

77
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,473
I've asked the Prince...

78
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,393
...to make you Governor

79
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,556
The Prince despises me

80
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,755
I know

81
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,557
But if I'm not here...

82
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,319
...he will look at you differently

83
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,552
Since we were little I always got what you don't
want

84
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,991
I do not feel like a man

85
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,997
We grew up together. I share everything with
you

86
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,719
You really don't want to be Governor?

87
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,473
I seek the highest ideal in wushu

88
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,954
And I want to start my own school...

89
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,957
...so I can teach others

90
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,875
When my wushu practice flourishes...

91
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,879
...I'll realize the true meaning of life

92
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,472
My other wish...

93
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,433
...is to have a family with Ying...

94
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,955
...and live peaceful together

95
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,276
You and my little sister... a family?

96
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,310
Su

97
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,637
I wish the two of you all the best!

98
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,069
You've been so kind

99
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,909
One day...

100
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,753
...I'll repay you

101
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,596
That's great!

102
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,869
Guests come to see my parents

103
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,552
My parents are not in

104
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,519
I ask the guests to take a seat...

105
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,556
...then pour them tea

106
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,751
One more time!

107
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,918
Snake!

108
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,795
A snake! At your feet!

109
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,234
You lied!

110
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,833
Look at you. A mother and still so
rambunctious

111
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,353
You don't pay any attention to us

112
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,669
You just practice wushu all day

113
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,396
Who doesn't pay attention to you?

114
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,909
Mother! Father! What about me?

115
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,474
Help! Save me!

116
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,155
What's going on?

117
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,549
I want to play

118
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,234
You two are parents...

119
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,989
...but act like crazy children

120
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,518
Father

121
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,197
Grandfather

122
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,758
Little Feng

123
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,511
Give me a hug

124
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,235
Grandfather

125
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,555
Have you been good?

126
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,039
I have some news

127
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,190
Yuan is coming back for a visit

128
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,315
My brother is coming home?

129
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,748
Grandfather!

130
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,919
After all these years...

131
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,555
...I knew he'd return one day

132
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,270
Ying, let's get out the best wine

133
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,754
We must celebrate

134
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,231
My son

135
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,238
Yuan is now a Governor

136
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,995
I suspect this is more than a homecoming

137
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,675
You must be cautious

138
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,712
Father, you worry too much

139
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,518
Are you still thinking of his real father?

140
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,514
Yuan never uttered a word about him

141
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,917
He knows why you killed his father

142
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,355
Not mentioned does not mean forgotten

143
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,790
You raised him and Ying as your own

144
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,792
Ying is my wife. We are one family

145
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,035
There should be no hard feelings

146
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,918
Stop worrying

147
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,753
I hope you're right

148
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,591
Thank you!

149
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,110
Thank you! This way please!

150
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,595
Thanks!

151
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,512
Thank you!

152
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,109
Hurry, hurry! Father's school opens today

153
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,033
I want to watch the Lion Dance Ok

154
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,236
Lower the carriage

155
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,795
Raise the carriage

156
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,159
Do you still remember me?

157
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,352
Of course. You're my only brother

158
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,956
Little Feng. This is Uncle Yuan

159
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,552
Little Feng

160
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,312
You're Su's son

161
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,674
You should be brave

162
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,513
Father really misses you

163
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,392
Really! Then let's celebrate his birthday

164
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,073
I have to tell you something T ell me
tomorrow

165
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,638
Come!

166
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,072
The three of us we look like a family

167
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,789
My dear Father

168
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,558
Happy Birthday

169
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,799
Your timing is perfect

170
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,554
Everyone missed you

171
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,799
We're so happy you're home

172
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,110
Father, I have not re-paid you...

173
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,474
...for raising me and Ying

174
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,113
My health has deteriorated

175
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,278
Age has taken its toll

176
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,432
I don't have many good days

177
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,836
But I pray everyday...

178
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,999
...for your safe return

179
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,436
Come

180
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,837
We have much to catch up

181
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,352
Come!

182
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,230
Grandfather!

183
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,758
It was I who killed your father

184
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,676
Su loves you as his brother

185
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,398
Please spare his family

186
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,116
Father

187
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,075
You think so little of Su, your own son?

188
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,395
You father went too far with the Five Venom
Fists

189
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,754
He turned evil and killed many

190
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,552
You

191
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,434
I had to stop him

192
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,558
I have perfected the Five Venom Fists

193
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,953
Did you think I will ever forget...

194
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,120
...that you murdered my father?

195
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,993
After you killed him...

196
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,876
...you forced me to be your son

197
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,238
You told the world...

198
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,879
...my father deserved to die

199
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,357
Right?

200
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,837
I am the only one you should hate

201
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,556
Your son stole my only sister

202
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,634
Governor. We've got her

203
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,111
Mother!

204
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,989
Don't ever touch my sister!

205
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,189
I never blamed you

206
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,156
Ying, we are finally together

207
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,719
What will you do to Su?

208
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,996
Uncle, what's in your hand?

209
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,750
It's a pig's head

210
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,469
Let's go pay respects to your maternal
grandfather

211
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,195
Let us go

212
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,909
Su treated you as his blood brother

213
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,672
Mother

214
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,396
Thank you

215
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,999
Excuse me! This way please!

216
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,836
Young Master!

217
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,951
Something terrible has happened

218
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,189
What's going on?

219
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,795
Yuan killed the Elder Master

220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,956
He came for revenge

221
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,430
Young Master

222
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,512
Father!

223
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,430
Father!

224
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,996
Father!

225
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,637
Father!

226
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,072
Father!

227
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,151
Father!

228
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,512
Father

229
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,829
It's been 1 8 years

230
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,310
T oday, I've finally avenged your death

231
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,638
Forgive me for taking so long

232
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,710
Come, Little Feng

233
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,351
Brother

234
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,117
Little Feng, come here

235
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,349
Pay respects to your maternal grandfather

236
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,278
Governor. Su's here!

237
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,155
Yuan. How could you?

238
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,957
Stop!

239
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,349
Iron Twins, stand down

240
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,672
I must welcome my brother-in-law

241
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,477
Yuan!

242
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,234
Father always treated you as his own

243
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,668
How could you?

244
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,271
Su

245
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,392
Be careful

246
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,676
Su, run. We'll will be OK

247
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,916
Your blood will be an offering to my father

248
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,198
It's dark gold armor

249
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,549
It's sewn onto my flesh inch by inch

250
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,430
I am invincible

251
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,513
Your fist is harder than a blade

252
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,189
Five Venom Fists?

253
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,550
Su!

254
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,677
Su!

255
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,634
You know what your father said before he
died?

256
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,719
He begged me to spare your life!

257
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,197
You have no humanity

258
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,475
I've hated your family...

259
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,315
...for a long time

260
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,356
Father!

261
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,117
Little Feng!

262
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,435
Uncle Little Feng!

263
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,559
Please don't hurt my father

264
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,637
Little Feng

265
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,839
Run

266
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,189
Stop! Stop!

267
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,631
Run. Little Feng Uncle. Please stop

268
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,671
Come here. Little Feng. I'll stop

269
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,116
For the sake of your son, I'll let you go

270
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,471
Brother

271
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,396
Brother

272
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,228
Su! Father!

273
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,157
You're Little Feng's Uncle

274
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,150
Ying. Don't!

275
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,194
Mother!

276
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,476
Ying!

277
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,471
Someone save her!

278
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,349
Ying!

279
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,919
Governor. The water's too fast

280
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,076
Su

281
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,470
Su!

282
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,111
Dr. Yu, he woke up!

283
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,230
Su! Good

284
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,794
No more worries. He's OK

285
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,836
You're...

286
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,073
This is Dr. Yu

287
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,037
She saved our lives and treated your wounds

288
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,236
Ying told me everything

289
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,999
You are safe now

290
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,959
I am the only one here on Beidou Mountain

291
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,432
You can stay as long as you like

292
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,789
Thank you

293
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,870
Keep still. There're still traces of toxin in your
blood

294
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,792
Luckily you're strong

295
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,111
I was able to expel the toxin

296
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,916
Someone not as tough would be dead by now

297
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,396
Be careful. My blood is toxic

298
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,036
No worries

299
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,113
Dr. Yu has researched every herb

300
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,271
She is now immune to all poisons

301
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,871
I am eternally grateful!

302
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,474
I must thank Ying. She tends to the
wine-making...

303
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,551
...so I can focus on my research

304
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,958
She's a wine-maker?

305
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,316
She sells her wine in the city...

306
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,391
...and distributes the money to the poor

307
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,595
She also provides medicine to the sick

308
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,836
A true angel of mercy

309
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,749
You are making too much of what I do

310
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,030
These needles will aid my research

311
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,399
I'll walk you out

312
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,711
Most people harbor hatred...

313
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,753
...without realizing the value of life

314
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,914
One life is connected to many hearts

315
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,436
Ying

316
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,231
What's wrong with my arm?

317
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,235
The tendons are torn

318
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,756
Dr. Yu said you'll be OK

319
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,433
With time, your strength will return

320
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,590
Eat something

321
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,715
You should've stayed with Little Feng

322
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,272
Why suffer here?

323
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,876
Yuan will not harm Little Feng

324
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,039
If I didn't save you,

325
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,113
you would die

326
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,749
Look at me

327
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,675
I can't even hold a rice bowl

328
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,672
How can I save our son?

329
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,670
You never accept defeat

330
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,114
I am just an invalid

331
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,429
No, you're not an invalid!

332
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,670
You always seek a worthy opponent

333
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,995
Now you've found two

334
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,674
Yuan... and yourself

335
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,678
Su!

336
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,958
Su. It's OK

337
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,035
Here. Hold this

338
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,513
Use your right hand

339
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,517
Come on!

340
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,550
Hold it

341
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,237
So what if I can hold it

342
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,834
I'm still useless!

343
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,633
Are you all right?

344
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,829
Are you afraid?

345
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,515
Yes. I am

346
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,551
But I'm more afraid you'll give up

347
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,597
You're the only hope for our family

348
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,790
I'm waiting for you to come to your senses

349
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,720
You always seek a worthy opponent

350
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,190
Yuan... and yourself

351
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,149
You're not an invalid

352
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,597
You never accept defeat

353
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,956
T ry some

354
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,028
Now I understand...

355
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,350
...why your wine is so special

356
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,396
Why?

357
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,719
Because it contains your essence

358
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,035
Oh. Stop it!

359
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,996
Soon my strength will return

360
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,673
And I will rescue our son

361
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,149
Great levitating skill!

362
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,798
I've never met a skilled master like you

363
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,394
Please take me as your disciple

364
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,553
Why? For revenge?

365
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,910
How do you know?

366
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,358
Your eyes revealed everything!

367
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,755
T o be our disciple...

368
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,998
...you must first defeat the God of Wushu

369
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,030
The God of Wushu?

370
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,035
How can I defeat him?

371
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,033
Your right arm was damaged

372
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,435
Now it's healed

373
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,839
But you've lost your confidence, right?

374
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,796
No!

375
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,839
I have not lost confidence. My arm is fine

376
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,073
You might die...

377
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,079
...fighting the God of Wushu

378
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,193
If my skills are weak...

379
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,639
...what's the point of living?

380
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,270
Are you afraid now?

381
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,069
Go home if you're scared

382
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,071
Never!

383
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,635
T oo slow

384
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,152
Quicker! Quicker!

385
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,389
T o challenge someone like you...

386
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,354
...is a dream come true...

387
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,238
...for me

388
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,837
What did they do to you?

389
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,030
Nothing!

390
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,877
Only the weak die at home

391
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,753
A warrior dies on the battlefield

392
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,990
Su!

393
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,759
Finally you've come to your senses

394
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,394
Yes, like you said...

395
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,355
...I'm the hope of our family

396
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,475
God of Wushu!

397
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,628
God of Wushu!

398
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,231
I'm here. Still alive!

399
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,436
You've recovered?

400
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,272
Your right arm is worthless

401
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,358
Let's chop it off

402
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,270
Scared?

403
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,115
Again!

404
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,439
Ying said your arm has strengthened

405
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,557
T ake a look

406
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,315
Let me check how you're doing

407
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:13,958
Alright!

408
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,072
The toxin's gone

409
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,917
Thank you so much

410
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,792
My body has healed

411
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,758
And I'm getting stronger each day

412
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,913
I must go practice. Please enjoy dinner

413
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:43,952
Ying

414
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,550
Su has gone too far with his training

415
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,989
That's not possible

416
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,672
Please listen

417
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,355
His pulse is erratic

418
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,436
His heart is racing...

419
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,715
...and his eyes are blood-shot

420
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,038
He's going mad

421
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,794
This can't continue. His training must stop

422
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,037
Dr. Yu, he's with me everyday

423
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,749
He goes off to the Old Sage daily...

424
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,592
...and returns home with wounds

425
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,877
I see it with my own eyes

426
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,195
On Beidou Mountain...

427
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,948
...we're the only ones here

428
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,918
I know it's hard to believe

429
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,628
Old Sage and the God of Wushu are supreme
beings

430
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,917
Just like you, they come and go....

431
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,472
Have you ever met the Old Sage?

432
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,197
No

433
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,510
But...

434
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,879
I believe in my husband

435
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,275
How many times have I told you?

436
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,709
Do no enter my practice chamber!

437
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,109
You don't listen!

438
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,352
If you die, I'll be alone forever!

439
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,592
Uncle, my feet hurt. Please don't lock me up

440
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,909
If you try to run away...

441
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,909
...I'll chop off your feet

442
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,596
Uncle, I won't

443
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,550
Little Feng

444
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,078
You're my only family now

445
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,112
I will not loose you

446
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,833
I will protect you

447
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,038
So no one can harm you

448
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,639
It's been another year

449
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,915
I wonder how Little Feng has grown

450
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,714
I've been thinking

451
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,238
After Little Feng's rescued...

452
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,670
...we'll move to the plains

453
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,354
We'll hold hands like this every day

454
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,677
I haven't seen your smile in a long time

455
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,309
Su

456
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,155
After we save our son...

457
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,951
...would you spare my brother's life?

458
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,150
He's part of our family

459
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,593
If he lives...

460
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,318
...I'll make sure he cannot fight again

461
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,550
Heavenly God. Please bless our family

462
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,555
I pray that we shall never be apart

463
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,269
We shall never be apart

464
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,957
I must find a way to defeat you

465
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,192
Have you ever met the Old Sage?

466
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,351
Su has gone too far with his training

467
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,471
God of Wushu. Let's go again

468
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,837
You may be strong. But I'm stronger

469
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,510
I will defeat you

470
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,836
Ying. I'm home

471
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,879
I almost beat the God of Wushu today

472
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,390
He's really powerful

473
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,200
But I'll defeat him one day

474
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:11,877
That's enough

475
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,435
I now realize the way to defeat an enemy

476
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,470
I said. That's enough!

477
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,758
What God of Wushu?

478
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,510
Are you alright?

479
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,590
Su

480
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,237
Do you know you're going mad?

481
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,476
What?

482
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,036
I said, you're going mad

483
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,718
I'm getting stronger

484
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,228
And I'm more powerful than before

485
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,755
I know you miss Little Feng

486
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,270
I went to the cliff to watch you practice

487
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,714
I didn't see the God of Wushu...

488
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,071
...or an Old Sage

489
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,230
You were alone

490
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,875
It's all in your head. Don't you realize?

491
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,193
You went to the Cliff?

492
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,152
I promised the Masters not to bring...

493
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,991
Wake up!

494
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,749
You were practicing by yourself

495
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,154
Don't you understand?

496
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,479
That's impossible

497
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,070
Look at my wounds

498
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,111
They are real

499
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,593
You did it to yourself

500
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,591
I know you suffer so much

501
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,639
Are you not feeling well?

502
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,389
If you love me, you have to believe me

503
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,710
It's you

504
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,993
Making me want to be strong

505
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,272
I need you to believe in me

506
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,752
Guests come to see my parents

507
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,996
My parents are not in

508
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:13,519
I ask the guests to take a seat...

509
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,711
...then serve them tea

510
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:28,554
Guests come to see my parents

511
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,479
My parents are not in

512
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:43,990
I ask the guests to take a seat...

513
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:51,679
...then serve them tea

514
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,113
Little Feng

515
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,469
Let's go home

516
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,353
Go home, alright?

517
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,632
If Little Feng hears me sing...

518
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,719
...he will stop crying

519
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,029
Su

520
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,838
We are husband and wife

521
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,833
We share good times...

522
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,868
...and bad...

523
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,518
...and this wine together

524
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,992
Su, you show great improvement

525
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,356
Yes! I've become much stronger

526
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,749
Even your confidence has returned

527
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,672
Ying says I'm going mad

528
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,673
She says you're an illusion

529
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,955
What do you think?

530
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,116
Who are you?

531
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,396
Who are you? Who am l? It's not important

532
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,997
What's important is you're ready for revenge

533
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,748
Ying is right

534
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,758
You are just in my head

535
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,951
Leave me alone! I never want to see you
again!

536
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,596
Ying!

537
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,355
Ying!

538
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,955
Ying!

539
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,110
My Dear Su

540
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,949
Watching you live in your own fantasy scares
me

541
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,028
I fear I'll lose you and our son forever

542
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,239
It is now clear to me that I must go save Little
Feng!

543
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,995
We made a promise. Our family shall never be
apart

544
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,189
Wait for my return. Ying

545
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,431
Please

546
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,039
How long has he been in here?

547
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,829
Little Feng!

548
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,676
Mother!

549
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,710
Little Feng!

550
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,312
Little Feng!

551
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,513
I thought I'd never see you again!

552
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,192
I miss you so much!

553
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,273
Why are you in chains?

554
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,191
Hush!

555
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,636
Uncle may hear us

556
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,630
Ying?

557
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,116
You're alive!

558
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,195
This is great!

559
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,275
This is great!

560
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,148
Finally, we can live happily as a family

561
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,755
It's been so long

562
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,868
Do you know the pain I've endured?

563
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,793
I think of you every day

564
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,193
You've had your revenge. Now let my son go

565
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,028
Is Su dead?

566
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,912
You decimated him

567
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,678
He can never fight again

568
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,915
Please let us go

569
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,114
Now that you're here

570
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,357
I'll never loose you again

571
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,719
He's here! He's here!

572
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,757
Close the gate. Quick!

573
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,430
Governor! Su is fast approaching!

574
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,910
Su!

575
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,550
Ying. I am so happy

576
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,748
Gratitude! Hatred! It all ends here!

577
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,273
Then you must deal with me first!

578
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,111
Mother!

579
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,793
You're scaring your son

580
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,312
Does this make you happy?

581
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,237
Happy?

582
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,471
I've known only sorrow since you left

583
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,231
I can only fight for what I want

584
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,034
You understand?

585
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,597
Good!

586
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,753
That's more like it, Su!

587
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,034
Su, I should have trusted you!

588
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,350
I was wrong!

589
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,151
Ying!

590
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:42,871
Guards

591
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,915
Tie her up

592
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:47,995
Little Feng! Mother!

593
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,912
Little Feng!

594
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:50,991
Mother!

595
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,912
Uncle! Don't kill her!

596
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:53,950
Little Feng!

597
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,390
Let go!

598
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,868
Mother! Little Feng!

599
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,230
Su!

600
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,832
Little Feng

601
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,592
Mother!

602
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,869
I won't kill your mother

603
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,158
But if I'm killed by your father

604
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,752
She has to die with me

605
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,994
Because we're one family

606
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,359
But I will not lose

607
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:14,672
Bury her in the forest!

608
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,312
Little Feng!

609
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,550
Mother!

610
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:18,950
Little Feng Mother!

611
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,350
No matter what happens. You must stay with
your father

612
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,193
Remember our family shall never be apart!

613
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,836
Mother!

614
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,238
Promise me, Little Feng! Promise me!

615
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,550
Mother!

616
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,319
Governor, it's been done

617
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,872
Does anyone else know where she is?

618
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,632
No

619
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,913
Good! Get up!

620
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,075
Yes. Sir!

621
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,591
Kill him, Brother! Quick!

622
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,316
Father!

623
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,190
Little Feng!

624
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,235
Where's your mother?

625
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,998
You'll never know

626
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,996
Father, stop! We need to find Mother!

627
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,995
Father, don't kill him!

628
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,714
Father, you're killing him!

629
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,472
Stop! Father!

630
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,592
Don't kill him!

631
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,991
Uncle, you can't die, please live

632
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,071
Little Feng, he is our enemy!

633
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,998
He buried Mother alive

634
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,953
Only he knows where she is!

635
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,958
If he dies...

636
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,355
...we can't save Mother

637
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,196
Let's go find her!

638
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,510
Forest...

639
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,069
In the forest...

640
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,116
Ying! Mother!

641
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,630
Mother!

642
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,440
Ying! Where are you?

643
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,788
Mother!

644
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,789
Ying!

645
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,108
Mother!

646
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:49,957
Mother!

647
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,751
Ying!

648
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,594
Mother!

649
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,670
Ying!

650
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,355
Mother!

651
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,351
Ying!

652
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,715
Mother!

653
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,559
Mother! Ying!

654
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,357
Ying!

655
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,310
Mother!

656
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,157
Here!

657
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,716
Mother!

658
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,832
Ying!

659
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,192
Mother!

660
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,034
Mother...

661
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,708
Careful! It's hot! Here it is, go!

662
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,429
Roast potatoes! Sweet roast potatoes!

663
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,948
Roast potatoes!

664
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,518
Mister, how much is one potato?

665
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,550
Two copper coins!

666
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,475
I only have one coin. Can I get one?

667
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,429
OK. Consider it charity

668
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,909
Here. One for you

669
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:47,996
Thank you

670
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,948
T eacher! T eacher!

671
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,235
Wake up!

672
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,156
Get out!

673
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,590
Our T eacher's dead! Money won't bring him
back

674
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,234
Your T eacher is inferior. Our fighters are
better

675
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,316
Stop!

676
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,355
Master Ma

677
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,672
Head of the Wushu Federation?

678
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,558
Master Ma. Please arbitrate

679
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,118
What happened?

680
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,033
They lured our teacher to a match for 30 silver
coins

681
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,878
Said he'd get 5 coins if he surrendered

682
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,315
But it wasn't a match. It was slaughter

683
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,035
Accidents happens. People die

684
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,351
He did surrender. Your men still beat him to
death

685
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,629
That's outrageous!

686
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,074
How can you call that a match?

687
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,718
If you have any greiviances, settle it in the
arena

688
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:04,437
All right!

689
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,109
T ell your people...

690
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,394
...if I win, they'll close the arena

691
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,589
And go back to where they came from!

692
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,115
Deal! We'll be waiting

693
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,788
Here. T ake this. Buy something to eat

694
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,076
Wine...

695
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,158
Wine...

696
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,911
Wine...

697
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,119
Wine...

698
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,117
Excuse me! Who is this guy?

699
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,076
Oh. My god!

700
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,636
How did a stinky begger get in here?

701
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,552
This is not Ying's wine

702
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,390
This is my wine. Give it back!

703
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,789
Don't push me

704
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,315
Get out!

705
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,230
You stink!

706
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,279
Don't touch me

707
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:14,997
Just wait!

708
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,712
I'll get someone to kick you out

709
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,678
Hey, come here if you want to drink!

710
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,156
Wine

711
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,153
Is this Ying's wine?

712
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,709
Drink, and you'll know

713
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,109
Wine...

714
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,471
Wine...

715
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,354
Give me the wine!

716
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:03,472
Wine...

717
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,596
Wine

718
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,076
Clear head. Drunken Form

719
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,397
Mind meets fist

720
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,278
Stop obsesssing about form

721
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,640
Heart and fist are one

722
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,678
T o lose is not to lose

723
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,991
T o win is not to win

724
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,034
Offer wine to the Gods

725
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,554
Hug the barrel in farewell

726
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,598
Raise the jug with tons of strength

727
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,799
Drunkeness is fake. The fist is real!

728
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,319
A good fist is an unstoppable fist

729
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,156
T ake it and drink up!

730
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:26,831
Father

731
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,191
Father

732
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,389
A broken heart needs mending

733
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,237
What are you doing here?

734
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,995
From now on, let me take you...

735
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,559
...to where you want to go

736
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,755
What a stench

737
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,192
Master Ma

738
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,039
This is the lunatic I told you about

739
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,109
Su Can?

740
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,510
General Su?

741
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,269
Oh... he is a General?

742
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,838
Su, it is Ma

743
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,836
We fought many battles together

744
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,437
What happened to you?

745
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,358
You don't remember me?

746
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,951
You gave me this sword. Don't you
remember?

747
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,234
Su. Wake up

748
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,878
Foreigners...

749
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,840
...are killing Chinese fighters for amusement

750
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,915
I have to...

751
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,798
...fight them tomorrow

752
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,318
Win or lose. I've no regrets

753
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,755
I've always looked up to you

754
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,231
A warrior once told me...

755
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,915
..."a great sword deserves a great warrior"

756
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,469
What happened...

757
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,834
...to that great warrior?

758
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,119
He...

759
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,552
...died with Ying

760
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,115
Mother!

761
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,669
Su!

762
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,233
For the sake of your son, pick yourself up

763
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,190
Su!

764
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,554
I return this sword to you

765
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,795
Ma!

766
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,557
I've never asked you for anything

767
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,956
Please take care of my son

768
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,958
Father! What are you saying?

769
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,759
Su! He is your son!

770
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,589
Look at me

771
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,518
Do I look like a father?

772
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,838
He has no future with me

773
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,832
Only suffering

774
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,709
I beg you

775
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,074
Please take him away!

776
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,516
I see

777
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,190
Don't worry

778
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,035
I'll take good care of him

779
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,309
I won't go with you!

780
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,115
Father

781
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:22,638
Don't send me away, we must stay together

782
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,119
Who will take care of you if I'm not here?

783
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,239
Father. I won't go, I want to stay

784
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,516
Father. I won't go

785
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,796
You don't need to take care of me. Now go!

786
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,949
Father. No!

787
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:38,992
Go!

788
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,556
No!

789
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,192
Listen!

790
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,070
I only need wine, not you

791
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:46,997
Understand?

792
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,876
I don't want to go

793
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,632
Su!

794
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,710
Father! Su!

795
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:56,956
Go!

796
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,269
Father!

797
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,990
Open the door!

798
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,116
I don't want to go!

799
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:12,439
Open the door! Father!

800
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,951
Father!

801
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,555
Uncle Ma

802
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,630
I'm sorry

803
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,068
But I can't leave him

804
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,793
He might be crazy. But he's my father

805
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,837
And we cannot be apart

806
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,669
I understand. Little Feng

807
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,158
Come to me if you need anything

808
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,711
Think of me as your family

809
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,193
T ake good care of your father!

810
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,430
Dear Father

811
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,673
I promised Mother...

812
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,519
...that I'd always stay with you

813
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,194
Our family shall never be apart

814
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,228
Uncle Ma!

815
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,115
We've come to support you

816
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,429
Ma!

817
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,516
Su!

818
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,432
Can you get us in?

819
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:18,956
Of course

820
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:24,950
Father!

821
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,429
Get out of here!

822

We have a dress code

826
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,434
He's with me. How dare you!

827
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,273

01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:44,036
I knew it. You've perfected your skills

910
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,799
Don't leave me again

911
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,996
I've never left you

912
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,356
I was always by your side

913
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,113
Father, wake up, get up quickly

Get up, Father! Don't leave me

918
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,873
Father, get up

919
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,037
Father. You're awake!

920
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,679
Get up! Quick!

921
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,430
Get up!

922
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,190
He's up. The Chinaman is up

923
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,599
He wins

924
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:54,156
The loser will be banned from this arena

925
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,509
Ladies and Gentlemen

926
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,279
According to our rules

927
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:03,713

01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,396
...the Chinese Man on this stage

930
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,029
That is my father!

931
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,556
Kid. Let me teach you a trick

932
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,034
Look at me

933
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,029
I saw the hole in the first place

934
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,715
You are a fake

935
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:19,676
I'm sorry
