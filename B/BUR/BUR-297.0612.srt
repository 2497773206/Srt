1
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:26,368
THE PLANET OF STORMS

2
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:39,147
<i>Attention! Moscow calling!</i>

3
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:41,582
<i>Moscow calling!</i>

4
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:47,943
<i>All radio stations
of the Soviet Union...</i>

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,214
<i>...broadcasting a TASS announcement.</i>

6
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:59,256
<i>Three astro-ships of a
Soviet space expedition...</i>

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,366
<i>..."Sirius." "Vega" and "Capella"...</i>

8
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:07,267
<i>...having travelled over
200 million kilometres...</i>

9
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:13,357
<i>...are approaching Venus.</i>

10
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,579
<i>The cosmonauts feel fine.</i>

11
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,032
They have come so far
and die near Venus...

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,594
We are still powerless
against big meteorites.

13
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:16,610
I can hardly believe it.
I just talked to them.

14
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,848
Earth calling!

15
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,932
<i>"Sirius!" "Vega!"</i>

16
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,201
<i>We are shocked at "Capella´s" fate.</i>

17
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:38,797
<i>We have faith in your courage.</i>

18
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,581
<i>Enter the sputnik orbit.</i>

19
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:47,819
<i>Investigate conditions on Venus.</i>

20
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,887
<i>"Arcturus" will be ready to take off...</i>

21
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:52,916
<i>...next week.</i>

22
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:01,316
It will journey for months.

23
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,285
Waiting is torture.

24
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,177
But you know the plan.

25
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:11,391
One ship remains in orbit with fuel.

26
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:14,830
Two land, for safety.

27
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:18,260
No one can land until
"Arcturus" arrives.

28
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,843
Ships can´t land what about people?

29
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,148
One alternative is for
"Vega´s" glider to land...

30
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,669
with Kern´s automat.

31
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,829
Let me land in the glider.

32
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:34,713
The glider doesn´t return.

33
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:38,877
I know. I`ll work and
wait for "Arcturus".

34
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,577
I´ll, accomplish more
than a hunk of steel.

35
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:45,124
Someone´s got to see
Venus with his own eyes.

36
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,483
What if something happens to you?

37
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,624
I won´t yell for help. I´ll put that...

38
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:56,458
...in writing.

39
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,666
My life is my own.

40
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,941
My life is my own...

41
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,107
Mr. Kenrl

42
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:24,472
We have a problem.

43
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,878
Half a minute!

44
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:36,839
I can´t believe they´re gone.

45
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:41,566
They were lucky. Instantaneous death.

46
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:49,836
Alyosha wants to land in a glider.

47
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,787
Why should "Vega´s" glider...

48
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:57,077
...be used by someone from "Sirio"?

49
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,682
We understand each other.

50
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,699
What´s it all about?

51
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,918
Nothing special...

52
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:12,604
Better to die usefully...

53
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,594
...than wait for a
meteorite to hit you...

54
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:23,016
...or radiation disease to get you.

55
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:27,398
- Earth won´t permit a landing.
- It must.

56
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,581
Let´s figure it out. Without
considering the danger.

57
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,969
Risk is standard behaviour in space.

58
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,259
Figure it out with the
help of your invention.

59
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:45,636
My firm has been
waiting for a real work.

60
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,270
7, 12, 9,

61
00:06:56,468 --> 00:07:00,962
Hello, John! Wake up!

62
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,677
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:09,871
Dear John, give us...

64
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:15,313
...the best plan for
landing with return...

65
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,783
...with only "Vega" and "Sirio" present.

66
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,645
There are seven of
us now, including you.

67
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:30,014
Ignore the danger factor.

68
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,499
"Vega" remains in orbit...

69
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,985
...with one man.

70
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,910
"Vega´s" glider lands three.

71
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:45,921
"Sirio" lands three, making six in all.

72
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:50,906
"Sirio" takes five back

73
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:54,211
The sixth remains on Venus.

74
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,562
- Who remains?
- I do, sir...

75
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:03,275
...being dead and the havest.

76
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,407
Mathematics is pitiless.

77
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,385
A rotten plan.

78
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,946
A good plan, but dangerous.

79
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:22,205
Who remains in orbit?

80
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:28,000
According to that plan I´m the only one.

81
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,284
No one else can process the...

82
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,443
...information and transmit it to Earth.

83
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:48,347
I´d always hoped for...

84
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:54,415
...something different.

85
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:59,997
I worked so hard for...

86
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,979
...so many years.

87
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:10,234
Sputnik, then the Moon You Know!

88
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,845
I hoped we´d be together.

89
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:19,358
What do you suggest?

90
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:23,792
I don´t know.

91
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:33,741
The international association
insists on the Robot.

92
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,699
It will a test for a whole
trend in cosmonautics.

93
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,790
And I have to see Venus.

94
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,121
Don´t I have to?

95
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,170
Another world.

96
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:59,078
We´ve sent automats there...

97
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,461
...so many times in recent years.

98
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:06,703
We´ve studied the atmosphere,
discovered oceans and continents...

99
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,962
...measured the temperature...

100
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:17,607
But the automats don´t tell
us about the main thing.

101
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,927
Is there life there?

102
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:30,820
Now man come himself to find out.

103
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,750
Get ready drop a beacon.

104
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,948
Surface pressure 2 and 3.

105
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,758
Cloud altitude 15.

106
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,816
Clouds of ashes above the coast.

107
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,731
Another carbondioxide centre.

108
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:55,029
A red glow can be seen
through the clouds.

109
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,073
Thousands of new facts and
nothing about the main...

110
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:07,029
...thing

111
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:08,972
- who lives there.

112
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:12,532
Nothing living has yet appeared.

113
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:17,290
Perhaps the red glow is...

114
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,066
...a lighted city.

115
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:24,121
It´s a dead planet.

116
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,813
Intelligence has
already destroyed itself.

117
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,586
Who is right?

118
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:37,512
Automats can never replace man.

119
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:52,452
<i>"Sirius!" "Vershininh!"</i>

120
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:04,987
<i>I don´t see a landing strip for "Sirio".</i>

121
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,396
Shall we change the place?

122
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:12,533
No, the assignment is to land here.

123
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,134
I have a suggestion.

124
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:18,202
We don´t need "Arcturus"

125
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,415
From one kilometre
altitude the glider...

126
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,021
...will find you a landing strip.

127
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,162
<i>- What if it doesn´t?
</i>

128
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,255
- They´ll put up statues to us.

129
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,990
Who´ll be the glider crew?

130
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,099
Kern. the Robot, myself.

131
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,602
Masha remains in orbit.

132
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:41,006
We´ll leave the Robot on Venus.

133
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:45,402
- You´ve got it all figured out!
- Long ago.

134
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,468
I wish I were with them.

135
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,801
It´s reckless!

136
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:07,919
Prepare a well-substantiated
report to headquarters.

137
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,955
Perhaps we´ll get permission.

138
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,635
- Ready?
- Yes.

139
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,143
GO!

140
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:31,773
I envy you, Shckerba...
You too, Allan Kern...

141
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,375
I understand you captain

142
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,581
Good luck, friends!

143
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,503
They´re approaching.

144
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,278
<i>Storm clouds... Lightning.</i>

145
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,161
<i>We´re turning the controls over to John.</i>

146
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:49,298
<i>A sheer cliff ahead. I´m climbing</i>

147
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:04,328
<i>Clouds on the ground.
We´re using the locator.</i>

148
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,007
<i>It´s bad so far.</i>

149
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,828
<i>Here´s a flat strip in a hollow.</i>

150
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,005
<i>Hard ground... Good for landing</i>

151
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,022
<i>We´re dropping the
beacon. Land in square 73</i>

152
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:22,581
<i>We´re being carried away
There´s water below...</i>

153
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,441
<i>We´ll land in a swamp.</i>

154
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:40,914
<i>Projecting rocks.
Chandes of destruction 90%</i>

155
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,708
<i>I´m landing.</i>

156
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:14,652
Calm down, Masha.

157
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,528
They´ve landed. We got
an image on the screen.

158
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:23,515
We´ll contact them at the next turn.

159
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,891
Shcherba! Hello!

160
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:51,852
Kern!

161
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:57,195
¡Shcherba! ¡Kern!... ¡Hola!

162
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,349
It looks bad.

163
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,857
Get ready. We´ll land now.

164
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:23,542
It´s calmer at night. Square 73

165
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,226
Masha, we´re going to land

166
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:37,424
Masha, we´re going to land

167
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,244
You´re remaining all alone in space.

168
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:46,783
Masha, dear.

169
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:52,055
Watch us with the locator.
You know what to do.

170
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,268
<i>I know...</i>

171
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:05,140
If we lose our lives,
keep yourself in hand.

172
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:11,075
<i>I understand! May I
cut the connection now?</i>

173
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,793
You may, my dear...

174
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:19,939
It´s hardest for the one who´s alone.

175
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,721
Earth!

176
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,138
<i>Flight headquarters permits...
...you to return at any time.</i>

177
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:32,467
<i>People are what counts.</i>

178
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:38,344
<i>We wish you luck. The
whole country is with you.</i>

179
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:47,702
Earth! Headquarters!
We´re landing as planned.

180
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:53,871
Landing square 73 chosen by glider.

181
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:59,925
We assure the Soviet
government, Party and people...

182
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,326
...that we´ll do all we can...

183
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,246
...to justify their trust in us.

184
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:18,478
If anything goes wrong,
help Masha. She´s alone.

185
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:22,406
Ilya, it´s time. I´m
removing the aerial.

186
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,455
Switching on the automat.

187
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,096
Square 73. Direct course by beacon.

188
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:16,029
So this is Venus!

189
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,139
Square 73.

190
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:26,574
What a strong downward pull!

191
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,859
Not used to it.

192
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:36,182
Hand land! Our scouts chose well.

193
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,118
We´re standing! Feels like the Earth.

194
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,950
I´m lifting the shades.

195
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,149
Give us some light, Roman.

196
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,814
A dense fog.

197
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,616
Let´s look around with a locator.

198
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,129
There´s a cliff 200 metres away...

199
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:10,356
...and some sort of protuberance here...

200
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:15,591
I´ll switch on the outside microphones.

201
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:46,080
Hear that? What can it be?

202
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,876
Let´s not lose time.

203
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:59,861
Use the infra-red viewer and locators.

204
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,104
Then we´ll transmit to Earth.

205
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,402
Do everything according to first plan.

206
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:13,349
When Masha emerges on the horizon...
...inform her we´ve landed.

207
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:14,765
Oh, I´ll boast!

208
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:17,777
We´ll boast when we´ve
rescued the others.

209
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,909
Do we start at dawn?

210
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,196
Yes, at 6 a.m.

211
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,801
I´m standing!

212
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,782
May I walk a few steps?

213
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,096
Careful, feel your way.

214
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:25,472
An ordinary stone...

215
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,156
ordinary water...

216
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:58,367
I can hardly believe it.

217
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,257
Alyosha, turn back.

218
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:41,385
- Masha found the glider.
- Are they alive?

219
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:45,074
She located tow metal objects.

220
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:48,365
One is moving... Robot, probably

221
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,941
- No word?
- The radio may have broken.

222
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:49,005
- Alive?
- Alive!

223
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:52,723
The space suit´s whole.

224
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,597
I´ll photograph it.

225
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,586
There´s life here. That´s
the important thing.

226
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:17,148
You´re in too much of a
hurry. We´re just in time.

227
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,808
- How´d you find out?
- We heard a shouts.

228
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,429
- So did I
- Strange!

229
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,000
Anything´s possible on Venus.

230
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:33,902
What else did Masha say?

231
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:37,815
I was so worried about you all.

232
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:41,146
I´m so happy.

233
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:45,013
I sang songs and then
I flew about the cabin.

234
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,341
I took off my magnetized shoes and flew.

235
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:10,382
We´d like details.

236
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:15,022
Sorry, I lost my head.

237
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:18,970
They´re in the square
beyond the red glow

238
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:24,175
That´s 32 km away from
you across the gulf.

239
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:29,660
Get the cross country car ready.

240
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:34,271
That´s a long distance for it.

241
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:35,658
What do you suggest?

242
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:42,160
Not to land on Venus in gliders.

243
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,824
Are they alive?

244
00:27:55,998 --> 00:28:00,312
Couldn´t the Robot have
begun to move by itself?

245
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:11,972
I understand you.

246
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,035
It could not have. It wasn´t assembled.

247
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:19,501
They assembled it there.

248
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:34,850
Stop!

249
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,439
Imps of the devil!

250
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:05,557
Hol on another minute.

251
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:10,078
That was some blow, John.

252
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,801
Course 110. Base,
yourselves on the cliff.

253
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,085
Stretch a cable across.

254
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,194
Yes, sir.

255
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:56,305
Ordinary men...

256
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,183
...cannot conquer these wild planets.

257
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,570
Steel men are better suited.

258
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:05,764
A small tank would be more practical.

259
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:08,884
A man is more attractive.

260
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,426
You go first. I´ll help.

261
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:39,491
- Shall we stop?
- Yes, let´s look around.

262
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,272
There´s another one!

263
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,112
Looks like a brontosaurus

264
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,259
I´ll get a blood sample

265
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:04,515
Careful!

266
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,722
And measure his temperature.

267
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,483
He´s only just realized.

268
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:32,870
What did Masha say?

269
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,687
The Robot is moving
towards us, but slowly.

270
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:51,040
Don´t hurry.

271
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,582
There´s oxygen for only 24 hours.

272
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,429
They must be looking
for us. Coming this way.

273
00:31:57,843 --> 00:32:01,146
Through this hell? No!

274
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:04,827
People are natural cowards and egoists.

275
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,771
People are natural friends!

276
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:18,169
We´ve caught malaria.

277
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:25,520
Infection has got in.
We´ve torn our suits badly.

278
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,538
Let´s take some quinocillin.

279
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:33,444
We´ve no time to lie down
afterwards as prescribed.

280
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:37,601
It will pass. Come on.

281
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:08,295
How far is it to the other shore?

282
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:10,604
10 km, across the gulf, 70 around it.

283
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,744
- Listen.
- Let´s sit down.

284
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,488
The same voice.

285
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:09,186
A squid of some sort. There
are plenty of vermin around.

286
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:20,760
- It´s a human being.
- A woman, perhaps?

287
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,831
You´d better recall Darwin!

288
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,488
How can Man appear in
the dinosaur period?

289
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,809
- We´re here.
-  We flew here.

290
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:38,169
Alyosha´s right.

291
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,883
Man is a space flier.

292
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:45,311
There you go again.

293
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,300
Darwin´s theory...

294
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,695
...applies to. Mans evolution and pot...

295
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:54,691
...to his distribution
among the planets.

296
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:59,574
That´s in Tsiolkovsky´s field.

297
00:35:00,644 --> 00:35:04,919
I wonder why they keep you
in the Academy of Sciences.

298
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:08,018
We´re the first arrivals from Earth

299
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:12,878
But there may have
been others before us.

300
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:56,106
There´s too much water from above.

301
00:35:56,177 --> 00:36:00,517
My mechanism is in
danger. I need shelter.

302
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:07,959
All right, John, find a cave.

303
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,186
I can´t stand it any more!

304
00:36:19,992 --> 00:36:21,394
Take yourself in hand!

305
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:27,940
We can´t stop here.
We´ll be washed away.

306
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:53,633
Hold on. Just a little longer...

307
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,589
Hey, John!

308
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:01,952
I´m in a cave.

309
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:08,829
Lighting 3.2 Luxe.

310
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,063
You´re a fine mathematician.

311
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:47,704
I feel I´m losing my mind.

312
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:51,932
By mathematical laws...

313
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:56,748
...there will be a world government...

314
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:01,088
A world government...

315
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,783
World advantage... World science...

316
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:13,163
No, Masha, they won´t miss us.

317
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,290
"Sirio"...

318
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:21,539
You can reach "Sirio" by car...

319
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,731
...in 37.2 minutes...

320
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:31,095
...over a concrete road.

321
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:45,306
Bad news from Masha.
The Robot´s disappeared.

322
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,500
Look for them. Maybe you´ll
hear their helmet phones.

323
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:58,311
I got them. It´s the Robot.

324
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:05,542
He´s talking nonsense. Listen!

325
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:10,332
<i>...the coast of building
a road to "Sirio"...</i>

326
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:15,601
<i>...at Smith prices will
be 57 million dollars.</i>

327
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,524
The machine is obviously
not controlled by anyone.

328
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:28,971
Listen you, Iron John...

329
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:33,090
The devil´s doll doesn´t answer.

330
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:37,223
The Robot reacts...

331
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,836
...only if polietely addressed.

332
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,525
The egg head!

333
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:45,925
Dear John, please...

334
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:49,059
...reply to us.

335
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:59,920
<i>Audibility 46,5%.</i>

336
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,651
Where are your masters?

337
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,516
<i>No masters.</i>

338
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:10,983
<i>Slaveholding is forbidden
by the Constitution.</i>

339
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,041
<i>I am a free, thinking machine.</i>

340
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,188
Describe your companions position.

341
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:23,268
<i>Horizontal position.</i>

342
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:28,443
- Where are you?
- Beneath a stone archway.

343
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,428
They´re in a cave.

344
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,145
That´s why Masha couldn´t locate them.

345
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:39,256
Dear John, what are your
companions talking about?

346
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:44,121
<i>About Masha, about
the world government...</i>

347
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:50,131
<i>...in witch I´ll be Prime Minister.</i>

348
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,721
- They´re delirious.
- Malaria.

349
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,681
Something must be done at once.

350
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:08,447
John, take quinocillin from the kit...

351
00:41:10,063 --> 00:41:15,812
Quinocillin
- tube No.2

352
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:40,480
9:15. Transmitted all data...
...collected by "Sirio" to Earth.

353
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:44,236
1:30. Passed over car.

354
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,645
They were entering the sea.

355
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:02,666
Something is flying
towards us on the right.

356
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:06,311
Changing form, rather solid.

357
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,603
Looks like a pterodactylus.

358
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,239
Pull down your helmets! It´s dangerous.

359
00:43:26,283 --> 00:43:28,484
- Did you get a photograph?
- Yes.

360
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:30,685
Then fire the gun.

361
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:33,235
The mechanism´s jammed.

362
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,738
A flying animal is attacking.

363
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:50,480
A heavy blow. Transmit to Earth.

364
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:54,985
What happened?

365
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:02,889
Transmit what?

366
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:16,587
- Ready?
- Ready.

367
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:27,906
They´ve disappeared.

368
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:47,437
This car´s not meant for underwater.

369
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:51,017
It´s the end for them.

370
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:03,040
If their space suits are
whole they´ll get out.

371
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:08,219
What if they´re hurt?

372
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:13,614
But if I land we won´t be
able to return to Earth.

373
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,584
Still, I must land.

374
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:27,415
I can land at the next turn.

375
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,048
In an hour´s time.

376
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:34,731
A whole hour to wait!

377
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,713
I must think ir out.

378
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:44,991
The Earth... Millions
of people worked...

379
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:49,658
...making a pyramid
to sky of their work.

380
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:55,319
They placed us on the
summit, trusted us.

381
00:45:55,966 --> 00:46:00,044
Now everything depends on me alone.

382
00:46:00,529 --> 00:46:04,499
And I don´t know what to do.

383
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:17,361
The instructions forbid
withdrawal form orbit.

384
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,190
If I land, return to
Earth becomes impossible.

385
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,785
But why save fuel if the men are dying?

386
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:34,616
The instructions could
not foresee everything.

387
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:39,795
My heart tells me they need me more.

388
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,573
I must inform Earth.

389
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:04,380
How hard it is to speak calmly.

390
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,943
Let them listen to my last recording.

391
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,717
The instrucions couldn´t
foresee everything...

392
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:18,404
My heart tells me they need me more...

393
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:35,116
<i>Hello! "Vega"! </i>

394
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:38,505
<i>Masha Ivanova! Masha Ivanova!</i>

395
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:42,805
<i>Earth is with you.
Take yourself in hand!</i>

396
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:48,784
<i>Do not withdraw from orbit.
All will be lost! Have courage!</i>

397
00:47:49,204 --> 00:47:52,307
<i>Earth asks you. Your Earth!</i>

398
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:56,555
My Earth!

399
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:51,344
<i>Wait for them in orbit,
or all will be lost.</i>

400
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,888
What shall I do?

401
00:48:56,301 --> 00:49:00,324
My time is nearly up. I must decide.

402
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:05,099
I cannot!

403
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:39,230
It was easier to sink
the car than to drag it.

404
00:49:39,698 --> 00:49:41,762
What resistance!

405
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:45,159
Let´s rest for a little while.

406
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,257
Interesting boulders.

407
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:06,874
I´ll take a look.

408
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:15,623
Very much like ours.

409
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:18,570
Conditions resemble ours.

410
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:31,848
Surely, nature could not have...

411
00:50:32,207 --> 00:50:35,429
...made such an even row of cliffs.

412
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:41,558
What if it is a sunken city?

413
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:51,251
Gave me a fright!

414
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:07,721
An entrance? Interesting!

415
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:13,644
Hope the owners are out.

416
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:30,549
What a strange triangular stone!

417
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:33,623
I´ll take ir along.

418
00:51:58,128 --> 00:52:00,023
Look at this!

419
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:04,195
- What is it?
- A Petrified dragon.

420
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:09,225
Perhaps it´s made of stone?

421
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,578
Made? What are you saying?

422
00:52:19,314 --> 00:52:20,876
An eye!

423
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:24,225
It´s ruby!

424
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:27,262
Put in by a rational being!

425
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:30,656
Hand me the buoy

426
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:31,891
Volcanic pourus iron is oxidizing and...

427
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:36,815
...stealing oxygen from the air.

428
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,557
Man can change that

429
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:45,590
Want to win a Noble Prize?

430
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,474
One can work for mankind without prizes.

431
00:54:09,723 --> 00:54:12,808
Ready, sir.

432
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:42,743
Give us our favourite song

433
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:51,248
The dragon with the ruby
eye us nade crudely...

434
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:54,286
...by a savage, perhaps.

435
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:59,012
But savages couldn´t
have flown to Venus.

436
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,946
Why not. Borbrov flew here.

437
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:10,308
Savages couldn´t have flown here.

438
00:56:10,754 --> 00:56:15,371
...but they could have
appeared on the spot.

439
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,657
Suppose civilized beings
had flown here and...

440
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:25,434
...remained for some unknown reason...

441
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,923
...and lost contact
with their own planet.

442
00:56:31,317 --> 00:56:36,615
In an alien atmosphere
and conditions they...

443
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:39,305
...would perish.

444
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,947
Some would survive...

445
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:46,278
...but go wild...

446
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:48,773
...in the brutal fight for survival...

447
00:56:49,152 --> 00:56:54,112
...and adjustment to local conditions.

448
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:58,010
No time for culture in that case.

449
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,937
Only the strong would survive.

450
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:04,383
And savages would appear
among the dinosaurs...

451
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:07,664
before the local apes...

452
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:10,773
...appeared and the future master...

453
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:14,740
...of the planet began to evolve.

454
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:26,676
Sounds like a warning.

455
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,322
We´re near the red glow.

456
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:56,804
- Is the gun in order?
- Yes.

457
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,508
It´s all very strange.

458
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,240
A buried city... The ruby.

459
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:19,179
That voice... Who could have flown here?

460
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,357
Inhabitants of another
planetary system, perhaps?

461
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:28,608
Martians?

462
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:33,421
On mars every drop of
moisture is a problem.

463
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:36,111
Here there is water everywhere.

464
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:40,678
Maybe they tried to resettle...

465
00:58:40,794 --> 00:58:43,844
...but failed and went wild...

466
00:58:44,893 --> 00:58:47,874
...and are advancing to
civilization for the second time.

467
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:53,665
Perhaps Martians once came to Earth...

468
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:59,440
...and we modern people...

469
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,839
We can go!

470
00:59:10,593 --> 00:59:12,574
I will find her!

471
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:41,067
It´s getting dark early.

472
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:43,314
No wonder.

473
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,255
There´s a cloud of ashes over us.

474
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:56,898
A volcanic eruption!

475
00:59:58,241 --> 00:59:59,746
So that´s the glow!

476
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:06,322
Your lighted "city"!

477
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,311
Rather inconvenient.

478
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:13,552
But we can get samples
of lava and ashes.

479
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:16,648
- Is the spectroscope in order?
- Yes

480
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:21,655
We must look an
elevation away from here.

481
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:26,985
A pity to leave this
magnificent spectacle

482
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:17,511
The lava is encircling us.

483
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:31,450
- Did you get a spectrum?
- Yes.

484
01:01:31,953 --> 01:01:33,988
From the crater edge?

485
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,597
No, it was too late.

486
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,649
Take us across the river of flame.

487
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:22,788
Audibility is improving.

488
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:25,363
What´s he got there?

489
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:30,654
I am giving our location as demanded.

490
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:35,303
The distance is two miles.

491
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:42,218
Why, it´s our men. And
you didn´t believe me.

492
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:47,686
Your machine is splendid.

493
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,076
At last you admit it.

494
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,946
The heat has reached 500 degress.

495
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:03,531
Further movment with a load...

496
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,942
...endangers my mechanism.

497
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,971
Turn off the self protection.

498
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:16,245
Open the door, panel 5.

499
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,343
Break the wire!

500
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:21,707
I don´t know which.

501
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,016
I can´t see from here.

502
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:29,343
I´m compelled to get rid of the load.

503
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,885
Damned fool!

504
01:03:43,463 --> 01:03:45,997
He´ll throw them into the lava!

505
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:59,773
So what´s more suitable
steel or flesh and blood?

506
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:03,402
Both are needed evidently.

507
01:07:05,736 --> 01:07:08,424
That´s better.

508
01:07:36,357 --> 01:07:37,530
How´s the radio?

509
01:07:39,453 --> 01:07:41,906
- Where´s Masha?
- Passing the zenith.

510
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:46,255
No sound from the radio.

511
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:02,998
Why are they numbered?

512
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,833
We hadn´t named them yet.

513
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,726
- Daughters?
- Sons!

514
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,584
A complete crew!

515
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:22,804
So you think rational beings
visited the Earth in the past?

516
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:25,253
There is no evidence of it

517
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:34,320
Many of history´s
mysteries could be evidence.

518
01:08:34,815 --> 01:08:37,569
The Stone. Age drawing...

519
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:40,830
...on a cliff in Sahara.

520
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:46,124
That´s right. It shows a man
wearing something like a space suit.

521
01:08:47,588 --> 01:08:50,875
And the ancient column in India.

522
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:53,718
The iron it is made of...

523
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:56,749
...was made by a
method unknown on Earth.

524
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:58,914
And the secret of Atlantis.

525
01:08:59,784 --> 01:09:03,308
And the extraordinary knowledge
of ancient astronomers.

526
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:08,055
None of that is evidence.

527
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:10,461
There is evidence in legends.

528
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:14,892
The descent of the goods
from heaven, for instance.

529
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:21,676
How would a savage here draw us?

530
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:26,870
Like saints with halos...

531
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:32,058
...and say that a god
had descended from the sky

532
01:09:34,195 --> 01:09:36,806
And there´s your text for local legends.

533
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:39,177
With illustractions!

534
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:42,944
Space flights are and
inevitable stage of...

535
01:09:43,482 --> 01:09:46,431
...development of life everywhere.

536
01:09:46,822 --> 01:09:49,640
Worlds are not isolated.

537
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:54,870
the migration of life
in space as natural

538
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:59,274
as... seed swept by the wind on Earth.

539
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:03,956
And branches of a single

540
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,002
...tribe of living beings are
developing in the solar system.

541
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:11,287
The solar tribe...

542
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:16,216
Then rational beings must be related

543
01:10:17,992 --> 01:10:19,807
Ah, to see her.

544
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,079
What is she like?

545
01:10:24,405 --> 01:10:26,937
Everything would become clear

546
01:12:05,232 --> 01:12:08,421
Your squid is happy you are unharmed

547
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:10,915
She is good and beautiful

548
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:14,139
Tomorrow we´ll try to catch her.

549
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:20,388
If she´s a Martian gone
wild, where are the others?

550
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:24,202
In some out of the way plane on Earth...

551
01:12:25,919 --> 01:12:29,080
...you wouldn´t meet anyone in two days.

552
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,132
And the telephone hasn´t
been invented here yet.

553
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:53,523
We´ve carried out our
programme. All this data!

554
01:13:00,107 --> 01:13:02,435
The stones go to the geologist.

555
01:13:02,914 --> 01:13:06,086
Let´s go to the radio.

556
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:22,982
<i>Vershinin, hurry.</i>

557
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:29,033
<i>A recording of Mashas´s transmission.</i>

558
01:13:31,928 --> 01:13:36,363
Perhaps "Sirio" will
receive this transmission.

559
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:41,791
The instructions requiere
that I remain in orbit...

560
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:45,256
...that I wait in idleness...

561
01:13:45,657 --> 01:13:49,968
...while my friends
may be in mortal danger.

562
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:54,611
I´m violating the instructions.

563
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,513
I am landing on Venus.

564
01:14:03,176 --> 01:14:05,672
I shall switch on the
engine in one minute.

565
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:22,571
- How could she?
- She didn´t think.

566
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:27,428
A Robot can think, not a woman.

567
01:14:28,612 --> 01:14:30,850
May God forgive me!

568
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:49,190
- She´s not in the sky.
- She must be.

569
01:14:50,734 --> 01:14:52,626
Hello! "Vega"!

570
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:57,225
"Vega" could have crashed or sunk.

571
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,962
We´d better inform Earth.

572
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:05,925
Our only contact with
Earth was via "Vega".

573
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:11,437
suggest that Shcherba,
Kern and Alyosha...

574
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,233
stay here for the time being.

575
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:19,891
Roman and I will go into orbit...

576
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:24,982
...find "Vega" and give
you the coordinates...

577
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:29,331
...trasmit our findings to Earth...

578
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:31,578
...and summon "Arcturús".

579
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,252
Unload the camping gear.

580
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,487
We´ve got to lighten "Sirio" anyway.

581
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:41,219
An earthquake!

582
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:44,117
The rocket has subsided.

583
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:04,281
The bluff is going under.

584
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:07,857
A mountain lake has broken through.

585
01:16:08,274 --> 01:16:10,731
Look, a fissure!

586
01:16:11,037 --> 01:16:14,056
If "Sirio" collaspses we´re finished.

587
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:17,548
Prepare for take off
quickly. Maybe we´ll make it.

588
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,678
When was Masha´s last
transmission recorded?

589
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,633
At 7:20.

590
01:17:00,922 --> 01:17:03,836
The locator recorded
the "Vega" passing...

591
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:06,488
...after that.

592
01:17:16,662 --> 01:17:18,274
She has not landed!

593
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:26,229
Masha, what happened?

594
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:30,511
I realized I was making a mistake.

595
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:35,464
I switched off the engine
but the orbit has changed.

596
01:17:36,093 --> 01:17:39,231
Then I located you at the red glow...

597
01:17:39,766 --> 01:17:42,782
...I watched, but you didn´t answer.

598
01:17:43,249 --> 01:17:45,913
Now they needn´t stay behind.

599
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:51,901
Right. Give us the new orbit.

600
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,275
All aboard!

601
01:17:58,137 --> 01:18:01,415
<i>Ivan, are you alive?</i>

602
01:18:06,602 --> 01:18:09,854
Alyosha, switch on the
meteorological station.

603
01:18:33,985 --> 01:18:36,287
Hurry, Alyosha!

604
01:18:56,924 --> 01:19:00,163
Ilya Scherba.

605
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:09,919
Wait! We can´t leave.

606
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,336
Look! They´re like us!

607
01:19:20,193 --> 01:19:23,230
They resemble us!

608
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:30,431
Wait! Where are you dragging me?

609
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,665
<i>"Planet of Storms". till we meet again.</i>

610
01:21:19,056 --> 01:21:22,209
<i>"Our ships will return to you".</i>

611
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:27,852
<i>"For we are sons of the Earth".</i>

612
01:21:45,815 --> 01:21:48,645
THE END
