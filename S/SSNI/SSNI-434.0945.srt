1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:09,436
Neteorra Reef Temple Trip,
It was committed by my boss for two days and one night.

2
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:24,078
Can I really go on an employee trip?

3
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,760
I've been retired for half a year.

4
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,830
It's okay, it's okay.

5
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,344
It's a temple trip after the year-end payment is over.

6
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:37,514
Our company's performance was good this year.

7
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,189
So in terms of encouragement,

8
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,729
I'm going to a temple trip to a luxury hot spring inn.

9
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:46,205
No problem with the couple.

10
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,202
Besides, you were an employee of our company.

11
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,157
It's even better.

12
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,813
I am a little embarrassed though.

13
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:02,606
I said to leave to get pregnant.

14
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:06,326
When I met again, I thought it was after I had a baby.

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,768
Time already, let's hurry.

16
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,428
2 years of marriage

17
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,659
At first I thought I could not depend on young Ryosuke.

18
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:27,791
In-company love dating at the same company

19
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,136
There was a lot of trouble in communicating with Ryosuke, who was three years old.

20
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,554
I feel trustworthy after marriage.

21
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:39,276
After my dad broke his ten million yen debt

22
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:44,236
My family factory was almost on the way to an auction because of my debt.

23
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,912
I thought my dad was over.

24
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:52,332
Ryosuke was able to get a loan somehow.

25
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:57,531
I am grateful enough for lack of thanks to Ryosuke.

26
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,750
So I want to have a baby.

27
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:04,460
I want to build a happy family with Ryosuke.

28
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,193
13:04 ...
Akane and hot springs, temple bus waiting

29
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:11,900
-Good morning
-Good morning

30
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,217
Good clothes, good.

31
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:17,017
Good morning

32
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,459
It's been a long time.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,316
It's been a while

34
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,039
- It's been a while.
-Iknow, right

35
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,957
Aoi, you look better.

36
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,024
Oh, is that it?

37
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:33,003
-How are you? - Good job.
- Did you miss me?

38
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,191
- It's not possible.
- It's all because of you.

39
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:40,719
- You stole our best Madonna.
-Sorry

40
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,367
- I'll put things in the car before you come.
-Please

41
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,241
please

42
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,503
- It's been a long time.
- It's been a long time, Mr. Aoi.

43
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:59,038
What's different, Mr. Aoi, your face is wide open?

44
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:01,519
- It's really good.
-No

45
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,808
How does it feel to be a real wife?

46
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,804
I wish I could, too.

47
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:10,449
Yes, I love it when I get married.

48
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:14,737
- Did you get pregnant?
- No. I have not done it yet.

49
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:18,626
Yes, you have not done it yet.

50
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:24,504
I know that? If a man is over 40, he will not do anything.

51
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:31,180
-is that so?
- Yeah, it's not like when I was young.

52
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,932
Yes, I know.

53
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,960
Because I'm still young, I can have it soon.

54
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,780
I really hope so.

55
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,582
So shall we go in?

56
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:44,446
So let's get cold.

57
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:53,712
Sawaki, it's been a while.

58
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,989
All right, you came.

59
00:03:56,724 --> 00:04:00,327
Would it be okay for an outsider like me to go on an employee trip?

60
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,777
Because the staff did their best,
I do not have a problem with the couple.

61
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,280
-Yes, Thank you
- Now, let's go.

62
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,940
Now, look at this, turn this one by one.

63
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,167
Thank you.

64
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,040
Here too

65
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,814
Do you think it's almost done?

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,287
- Everybody's holding a beer, right?
-Yeah

67
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:54,598
Thank you.

68
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,133
We have a great vacation with you.

69
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:03,574
At this time, year-end settlement is over.

70
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,742
We have a close relationship with the client in the future.

71
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,791
It is this season
It's all thanks to you guys.

72
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,064
So today is the New Year's Day.

73
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:23,937
Currently S1 accounting firm is showing a surge in earnings.

74
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:30,954
Next year,
Aimed at an organized accounting firm

75
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,110
He's been making good progress.

76
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:37,534
- Then the salary will be much higher.
- Oh ~

77
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:43,715
- And goodwill.
- Wow, that's good.

78
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,984
Next year's temple trip ...

79
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:50,818
- Let's go abroad.
- and ~ overseas travel

80
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,514
- Let's all work together.
-Okay

81
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:57,499
Hit the can.

82
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:07,080
- Now, toast
- Cheers ~

83
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,010
-Thank you
-Thank you

84
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:23,076
I was swayed, Tissue

85
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,873
The car will shake.

86
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:39,835
Does anyone have nausea?
I think I'll puke.

87
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,323
No one.

88
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,473
- I'm a good nuisance.
- Not really.

89
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,545
I was in the front row when I was in elementary school.

90
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,809
Hooch

91
00:06:57,878 --> 00:07:00,376
This is really inconvenient.

92
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,915
It's hard to sit, will I go inside?

93
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:55,578
- She wants to get pregnant.
-Yeah

94
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:01,687
- Are you pregnant?
-yet

95
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,934
- You have not done it yet.
-Yeah

96
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,169
This hand.

97
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:30,243
It's not different from the past.

98
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,189
The chest is big also

99
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:47,056
Still, the guy next to you is awkward.

100
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,828
Eyes that see me

101
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:54,154
The gaze pretending to be the best parent

102
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,092
If there is no other person, it reveals a canine.

103
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:02,506
When I'm in the company,

104
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,904
I was harassed.

105
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:12,387
(Arrive at 15:13 Akanezawa SA)

106
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,814
It's okay.

107
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,207
- Is Aoi okay?
- Aoi?

108
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,852
The manager was keeping an eye on him.

109
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,475
The manager likes her.

110
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,285
So you better be careful.

111
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,687
The general manager seems to be gentlemanly

112
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,345
It's totally different for a woman.

113
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:58,617
But ... Aoi is the wife of the employee.

114
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:02,166
- Should we do that?
-Do you really think so?

115
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:06,226
- I mean, really.
-right?

116
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,035
- Aoi's toilet?
-Yeah

117
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,494
Oh yeah, sell limited items here
Let's go quickly.

118
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,264
Let's go, let's go

119
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,630
Aoi, we'll go first.

120
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,889
Look at it a little.

121
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,705
It's about your company's closing.

122
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,547
you..

123
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:23,744
I wrote reverse accounting.

124
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:27,653
That's why I've lost 300 million yen.

125
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:32,593
That's Mr. Kuramoto of the Accounting Department.

126
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,062
I got a payment from the manager.

127
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,513
The former manager
If you made a payment,

128
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:42,053
You're deceived, I do not know that.

129
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:43,777
I do not think so.

130
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,030
Besides, you ...

131
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:49,983
I got bribes to Yamagura.

132
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:51,541
that's..

133
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,760
And at Aoi Papa Factory

134
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,274
I even loaned ten million won.

135
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,621
Bribery on suspicion of helping tax evasion

136
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:10,535
If this happens,
You know what happens?

137
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,640
First you'll be deprived of your tax agent status.

138
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,636
You will also live in prison.

139
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,477
Then you're ruined.

140
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,886
Our company

141
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,974
It's a big blow.

142
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,774
please forgive me

143
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,986
Manager, what should I do?

144
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,605
What should I do?

145
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,839
If you do not want to go into a cell,

146
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:45,420
It's all for me.

147
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,801
Because you did not know anything

148
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,998
I'll treat you as ignorant of them.

149
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:06,183
When you go back, you change the accountant's account book.

150
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:17,556
I'm in the food court, I'll talk to the rest later.

151
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,157
Ryosuke's tax evasion?

152
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:43,212
bit?

153
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,300
for me

154
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,570
He committed a crime to help his father.

155
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:59,570
Did you hear that?

156
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,333
It's all your husband did.

157
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,431
Really?

158
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,599
Ryosuke ... he got tax evasion at the company.

159
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:27,249
Hate

160
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:36,581
stop it

161
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,027
Let go, do not.

162
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,934
Doing

163
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,889
Would you like to go again?

164
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:16,121
16:22 ...
Â Aranzawa Onsen arrival, south accommodation

165
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:35,011
I finally arrived, it's hard

166
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,098
Wow ~ Nice room.

167
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,086
It's really cool.

168
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,579
we are here

169
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,082
Here's a hot spot, pretty famous.

170
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:51,813
-Oh yeah?
-Huh

171
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:54,611
I just wanted to see you once.

172
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,611
Well, good.

173
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,928
Onsen

174
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,859
- I'll be there first.
- Good.

175
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,744
Boss

176
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,821
This is a girl.

177
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,612
I know

178
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,414
I saw the sign before I came in.

179
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:51,894
I want to be with you.

180
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,404
It's beautiful, too.

181
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,642
I like the naked look.

182
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,559
Get out

183
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,481
Show me more.

184
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,526
I can see my breasts.

185
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,532
I do not think I forgot, did I?

186
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,088
What to do

187
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,084
Show me

188
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:51,099
-your
-It's not possible

189
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,971
My mind will change.

190
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,417
Do not you want to save your husband?

191
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:06,106
There's no way I can save her.

192
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:09,981
If you can change your books

193
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,647
Not all the sins are gone.

194
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,365
Who can do it?

195
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,370
You want to put him in jail?

196
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:30,815
Well, then you should give it to me.

197
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:36,113
Show me more.

198
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:39,061
I can not.

199
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:47,724
I can not help you with anything.

200
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,202
It'll be a while.

201
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,634
To respond to my heart

202
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,444
I do not like it

203
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,889
It's really smooth.

204
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:31,819
Stop it, I'll scream.

205
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:37,292
Then I

206
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,808
I can not cooperate with anything.

207
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:02,547
He's really good.

208
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,377
Please let me go.

209
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,914
I can not stand it.

210
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:33,270
I'm really tired.

211
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,179
Please stop it

212
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,471
It's getting harder.

213
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,622
You're keen.

214
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:16,105
It just happened to look like this.

215
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:25,930
No, stop it.

216
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,279
Please stop.

217
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:37,526
Please let me go.

218
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,508
Stop it.

219
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:49,358
If you want to scream, you scream.

220
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:08,430
Stop it, let go.

221
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,931
It's wet.

222
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:25,982
Please stop.

223
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:51,494
It's a killing ass.

224
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,220
Do not

225
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,765
Boss

226
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,626
It's for you guys.

227
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:24,424
I do not like it

228
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,590
Please let me go.

229
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:43,133
With that in mind,

230
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,548
This is different.

231
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:53,082
You're killing me.

232
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,598
Could you suck it with that cute mouth?

233
00:28:00,694 --> 00:28:02,599
- I can.
-I do not like it

234
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,825
Why I hate

235
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,045
It's okay.

236
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,389
Instead of sucking

237
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:45,808
Please let me go.

238
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,397
Even if you just look at it like this

239
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:55,651
I've been servering this many times, but what if I did something else?

240
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,105
Under a woman, it's your pussy too

241
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:05,588
I have an erection like this.

242
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,478
I need you to help me.

243
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,969
Can you do it?

244
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,995
Please suck it.

245
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,460
You can put it in.

246
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:54,961
Put it all right.

247
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,164
I really kill you.

248
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,470
Do it.

249
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,947
Give me a little more.

250
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,533
Good mood

251
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:52,051
Please feel good.

252
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:59,359
Put it a little deeper.

253
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:34,219
It's awesome.

254
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,505
I can not.

255
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:58,029
Please stop.

256
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,044
- You're wet.
- It is not.

257
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,501
Stop it.

258
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,880
It does not open.

259
00:32:15,854 --> 00:32:17,546
Who's there?

260
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:22,799
So is he Aoi? Aoi-san? Aoi-san?

261
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,754
- Just go into the water.
- Aoi? Aoi -

262
00:32:26,753 --> 00:32:29,652
- Anything?
-is not it?

263
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:38,265
- Aoi? Aoi-san? Is it missing?
- There must be ... Aoi.

264
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:41,442
- Are you with someone else?
- I do not think so.

265
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:44,893
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh.

266
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,874
- I'm afraid it's locked in.
- Oh, it's locked in here.

267
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:52,833
- So what about Aoi?
- Where is he?

268
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:56,754
I do not know? I went to the hot springs first.

269
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:01,453
- Where'd he go?
- Is not it an open-air bath?

270
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,384
- Oh, do you have an open-air bath?
- I like that.

271
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:09,052
- You want to go?
- Yeah, fine. Come on.

272
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:13,516
Okay, let's go to the open-air bath.

273
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,317
- Are you enjoying it?
- Yes.

274
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:22,209
Thank you very much.

275
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:25,682
This year has been a smooth year.
(18:05 ... temple trip, start of the field)

276
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,475
So I was able to come to this temple trip.

277
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,874
Let's enjoy the festivities now that we have plenty to prepare.

278
00:33:35,102 --> 00:33:37,805
You can enjoy yourself.

279
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,078
Then finally, Sawaki's manager
I'll listen to your drink.

280
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,984
Thank you, Sawaki.

281
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,125
Next year, we will further increase the company's performance.

282
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:55,628
Pleasing clients

283
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:59,272
I wish you all to be an accounting firm.

284
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,051
Yes

285
00:34:02,234 --> 00:34:04,971
Should not we do something like tax evasion?

286
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:06,598
I do not think so.

287
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,431
Accountants must be fair and fair

288
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:13,600
You can not touch a dishonest thing.

289
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:18,938
However,

290
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,184
We have to work together for taxation.

291
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:27,663
Let's make a toast for future development.

292
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:31,163
-Cheers
- Cheers ~

293
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,958
I will enjoy this food

294
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:43,895
Enjoy all the meals.

295
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,823
It looks really good.

296
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,802
- Aoi-san, do you drink well?
- No. I do not drink much.

297
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,944
-Oh, I see

298
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,824
The hot spring is open all day.

299
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:31,578
Yes? Do you open 24 hours?

300
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:46,341
But is there another drink? Get me some whiskey.

301
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:51,186
- Whiskey please.
- Me too.

302
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,780
You need a lot?

303
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,824
It's delicious.

304
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,563
I have a drink.

305
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:03,542
I brought the liquor.

306
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:08,696
- Bring it here.
- It's a set.

307
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:13,776
Here's a bottle.

308
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:19,338
Uh, turn that way too.

309
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,611
Reading 45 degrees

310
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,374
Hmm, come on.

311
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:36,239
I like drinking.

312
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:38,499
- Do you mind?
- Yes.

313
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:42,346
It's hot here, but it'll be okay.

314
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,704
It's a good drink.

315
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,728
OK?

316
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:11,759
You do not drink well.

317
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,099
You drank too much.

318
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:23,180
Ryosuke go and have more alcohol

319
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:25,150
-Ah yes
- Water, ice water

320
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,396
Ice water? Yeah

321
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,293
- Let's go pick it up with me.
-Thank you

322
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,087
Sorry

323
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:51,716
- Do you want a king game?
- The king game?

324
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:56,766
Gentlemen, here we are.

325
00:37:57,272 --> 00:38:00,528
Red is king. Pick one by one.

326
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,104
I can command you, here one by one

327
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:08,081
The king can command any order.

328
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,723
I'm really looking forward to it.

329
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,969
Oh please

330
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:21,621
Who is the king? Who is the king? Who is the king? character!

331
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:27,367
-Boss
- Dean, too.

332
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,320
- Be strong.
- Now.

333
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:32,410
-how will we do it
- It's fun.

334
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,130
Anybody kiss me?

335
00:38:34,155 --> 00:38:36,108
OMG! It's terrible.

336
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,817
character! I've decided.

337
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:39,904
- This time Aoi is here.
- So?

338
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:42,665
Aoi, why do not we get one shot?

339
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,971
It's okay.

340
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,332
-on? - One-shot one shot
- I'll take it.

341
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:51,999
- It's the king's order.
- The king's orders are absolute.

342
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:57,095
- This is smooth.
- Well, Sawaki has a very good manners.

343
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,627
- Is not it too much?
- It's okay.

344
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,323
It's barking.

345
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:06,970
-drink
-Yeah

346
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,696
Thank you.

347
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,307
-at a whack..
- I'll have a drink.

348
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:22,419
No, no, it's still there.

349
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:27,655
It's a long time ago.

350
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:30,073
It's so poisonous, it's really hard.

351
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,169
Drink this much here.

352
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,156
I will drink

353
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:37,007
It'll be fine this time.

354
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,111
Let's take a look at what's left.

355
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:42,698
Drink, drink, drink, drink

356
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:45,698
- That's all right.
- Let's look at it that way.

357
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:49,446
-please
- Let's have a quick look at this.

358
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,861
- It was dangerous.
- It's poisonous, too reading.

359
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:57,156
- Do you want to do it again?
-Yeah

360
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,735
Pick

361
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,024
Who is the king, who is the king, who is the king?

362
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,157
It's me

363
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:19,576
- I'm here again.
-What's up

364
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:22,676
It's strong.

365
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:26,767
- Drink more, drink.
- It's a bunch.

366
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:29,288
I really can not.

367
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:33,154
- Are you going to be an alcoholic?
-Iknow, right

368
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:36,739
- I'm going to be an alcoholic.
- Everything, all of it?

369
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,421
You have to drink everything.

370
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,890
It's not easy.

371
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,182
It's okay, it's okay.

372
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,011
I just want you to do it.

373
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:56,908
- Let's try it again.
- It's okay. It's okay.

374
00:40:56,939 --> 00:41:00,543
This time, let's leave the manager.

375
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:04,320
Pick it up.

376
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:09,734
- Please. - This time.
- You pull everything out? -just a second

377
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:14,475
I can not get my body shut.

378
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:17,276
Well, I'm looking forward to it

379
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:30,248
- Who is the king?
- It's me.

380
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:51,832
- Aoi, lie here like this.

381
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:21,641
And drink ...

382
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,335
At a glance, at a glance, at a drink, at a glance, at a drink ...

383
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:51,370
Who is the king?

384
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:55,850
- It's me again.
-What?

385
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,099
Strong

386
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,781
What would be better? What do you do?

387
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,512
What should be fun?

388
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:05,461
Do something different, other.

389
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:12,391
Yes, there was a hot spring.

390
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:16,905
- It's okay.
- Let's go. Let's go. - Why do not you take off your clothes?

391
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:21,701
What're you doing? Do not run away.

392
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,519
If you do, you can save your husband.

393
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:28,580
Actually

394
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:32,714
Your husband broke the law for you and your father.

395
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:36,210
Originally, it's all right.

396
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:38,694
You need to help.

397
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:42,990
- Look at this.
- What?

398
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,037
really?

399
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,095
Really? really?

400
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:50,830
-you can do it?
-I could

401
00:43:52,264 --> 00:43:55,595
Mr. Aoi supports you.

402
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,367
-OK?
- It's okay. Really?

403
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:01,223
OK? I think I'm drunk.

404
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,545
- I do not think the complexion is too good.
-OK? OK?

405
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:09,503
-No problem
- Okay, I'm fine.

406
00:44:13,603 --> 00:44:14,785
Sethet!

407
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:18,554
If you play baseball ~

408
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:22,649
This happens.

409
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:26,858
Out, Safe, Scissors Rock!

410
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:39,935
- I do not think so.
- I really need to get naked.

411
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,080
- I'll take it off.
-really?

412
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,978
- Is she really okay?
- Well then!

413
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:48,512
I'll take it.

414
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:50,460
- Our Madonna.
- Can you pull it off?

415
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:55,125
Can I do it? I'll solve it here.

416
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:01,582
- Turn around.
-Good

417
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:06,381
- Look at this. - What color?
- Show me once.

418
00:45:06,532 --> 00:45:08,452
Scissors rock again.

419
00:45:08,741 --> 00:45:10,971
Do it again? Yes, we should do it again.

420
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:14,233
- How many more times do we have to take off?
- How many are you wearing?

421
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:16,839
I have to win at least three more times.

422
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,640
Can I really take it all away?

423
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:21,513
- Shall we go next?
- Let's go.

424
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:23,346
Music start

425
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:27,339
When I play baseball

426
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:31,021
This happens.

427
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:34,743
Out, Safe, Scissors Rock!

428
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:39,790
- Hooray!
- I did it.

429
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:42,052
It's gone.

430
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:43,788
Take off

431
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,454
He's a really good friend.

432
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:48,359
It's okay. Are you okay? The manager succeeded.

433
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,144
Well done

434
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:53,239
The second is winning for the manager.

435
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,809
Then you'll be exaggerated.

436
00:45:54,997 --> 00:45:56,381
Thank you very much

437
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:59,683
Should we take off now? I'm going.

438
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:02,315
Please, take off.

439
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:08,750
- This is killing me.
- Aoi, the milk is big.

440
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:12,302
- Turn around, turn around.
- I have to turn around.

441
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:17,677
- Tee panties, tee pants.
- I want to look closer.

442
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:21,726
- Wait a minute.
- Can I touch it?

443
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,442
- Can I touch it?
- No, what are you talking about?

444
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,562
- Kill me. - Kill me.
-Very cute

445
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:29,665
What are you doing

446
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:35,695
- Show me more of this. - It's rare.
- Let me see more.

447
00:46:36,106 --> 00:46:39,764
- I'll just look.
- Wait, wait, wait.

448
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,602
What is it, what are you doing?

449
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:47,026
- Aoi, are you okay?
- That's what you wanted.

450
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:53,190
- I can do it. - Let go.
- It's just a game.

451
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:57,063
I'm too drunk, I'm pregnant, I'm going to do it.

452
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:59,438
Wait, get out of the way. I have to go to the room.

453
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:03,477
- I'm playing in the middle of it.
- Go back to our room.

454
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:09,050
- What are you really doing?
- It really hurts.

455
00:48:56,677 --> 00:48:59,380
-Boss
-Quiet

456
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:06,531
If you do not be quiet, people will break.

457
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,229
I do not like it

458
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:31,329
Do not you want to save your husband?

459
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:36,304
I can get it.

460
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,844
So be quiet.

461
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,019
Hate

462
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:57,021
Be quiet.

463
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:24,721
If you let me enjoy it,

464
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:26,976
That way,

465
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:30,522
You can not go to jail.

466
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:10,949
Yes, very good.

467
00:52:29,748 --> 00:52:32,060
I took a picture.

468
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,194
Stop it.

469
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,562
Okay, I got wet.

470
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:56,687
If you make a sound, I'll spread the picture.

471
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,811
I'll do it now.

472
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,022
But if you make a noise

473
00:53:13,825 --> 00:53:16,102
People will know.

474
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:21,589
no no

475
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:24,018
Do not do that

476
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:57,887
I'm soaked.

477
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:02,210
Please stop.

478
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:24,220
I'll catch you.

479
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,651
look

480
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:47,150
Do not shout

481
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:48,578
Sorry

482
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,898
I'm touching my pussy.

483
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,004
Good?

484
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,411
Now suck this.

485
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:09,621
Suck it up like before.

486
01:02:13,642 --> 01:02:15,682
Pictures are scattered.

487
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:18,976
My husband is going to jail too.

488
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:25,457
You just have to suck it up a little.

489
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,085
Do not cough, I'll catch you.

490
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:01,229
finally

491
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,812
Do not

492
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:33,038
I see you kill me.

493
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:03,797
I feel really good

494
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:11,718
Stop it.

495
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:17,140
Do not

496
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:58,079
Hate

497
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:20,634
There's a sound.

498
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:31,084
Give me your tongue.

499
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:34,980
Give me a long time.

500
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:04,920
I do not resist.

501
01:08:59,696 --> 01:09:01,589
I feel really good

502
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:15,215
I will kill you.

503
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,458
It feels good.

504
01:13:54,423 --> 01:13:56,203
If you do this

505
01:13:57,622 --> 01:13:59,748
It'd be better.

506
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:14,441
stop it

507
01:14:23,143 --> 01:14:25,378
I'll cover here.

508
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:27,917
I do not like it.

509
01:14:28,098 --> 01:14:30,500
- You should stick your tongue properly.
-Hate

510
01:14:32,808 --> 01:14:34,697
I do not like it.

511
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:53,429
Come out.

512
01:15:54,438 --> 01:15:58,383
Has Ryosuke ever done this before?

513
01:15:59,746 --> 01:16:01,574
He's really weak.

514
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,383
Since college

515
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:07,801
Sail on the wind

516
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,722
I grew up easily.

517
01:16:10,294 --> 01:16:12,302
We have to be weak.

518
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,754
That guy

519
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:21,323
If you go to jail

520
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,314
How are you gonna stay?

521
01:16:28,234 --> 01:16:29,937
I'm sorry.

522
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:35,979
Maybe not come back alive.

523
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,180
How can i

524
01:16:51,363 --> 01:16:54,975
Do you want to help? Then one thing

525
01:16:57,553 --> 01:16:59,580
Do not make suggestions.

526
01:17:00,546 --> 01:17:02,709
Your body

527
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:06,583
Let me write what I want.

528
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:10,638
I'll help you with Ryosuke.

529
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,060
I'll do anything I can.

530
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:23,204
Boss

531
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:26,651
Save him.

532
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:31,757
Accept the proposal

533
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:38,875
You can use my body at will.

534
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:48,197
All right, I promised.

535
01:18:41,076 --> 01:18:43,211
It was committed to the director.

536
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,015
You can not do it if you are committed.

537
01:18:49,185 --> 01:18:51,119
Did he betray Ryosuke?

538
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,831
No. This is to help Ryosuke.

539
01:18:57,348 --> 01:19:00,051
I can not make Ryosuke a criminal.

540
01:19:01,798 --> 01:19:04,219
It's okay if you put up with me.

541
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,505
That way

542
01:19:11,431 --> 01:19:12,780
Hello

543
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:19,105
Hello, Tsukasa?

544
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:23,139
Where did you go?

545
01:19:24,336 --> 01:19:26,739
Why do not you answer the phone?

546
01:19:29,386 --> 01:19:33,352
I thought I was a little drunk and I was taking a bath.

547
01:19:34,589 --> 01:19:36,764
Ryosuke, where are you now?

548
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:39,177
I

549
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:42,415
It's in the lounge inside the lobby.

550
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:45,584
It's like a simple snack bar.

551
01:19:46,338 --> 01:19:48,663
Uh, yes.

552
01:19:49,237 --> 01:19:50,528
That's why.

553
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:54,115
I was having a drink with my ladies.

554
01:19:54,245 --> 01:19:56,181
Come on, Aoi.

555
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:57,880
Will you come to Tsukasa?

556
01:19:58,261 --> 01:19:59,604
Aoi, come on.

557
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:03,862
I've been asking you from time to time.

558
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:06,624
I'm drinking with women.

559
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:08,615
I'm simply drinking

560
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:12,409
I said marriage was happy and I followed the liquor

561
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:14,226
To have a baby soon

562
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:16,401
Aoi is pregnant soon

563
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:21,121
Give it to me, give me a break.

564
01:20:21,224 --> 01:20:22,375
Give it back, give it back.

565
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,751
Aoi: Is your body okay? She said she was taking a bath and resting.

566
01:20:27,273 --> 01:20:31,273
- Aoi, Ryosuke was a lot drunk.
-Sorry

567
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,394
What do we do?

568
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,797
- Give me back.
-No no

569
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:39,913
- Tsukasa. I'm so sorry. I'm too drunk to take it.
-Okay

570
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,825
- Give me back quickly.
-okay okay

571
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:47,090
Aoi, help Ryosuke wobble.

572
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:51,275
- Have a drink together. I'll wait here.
-come fast

573
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:07,560
I can not be Ryosuke.
(23:09 ... Gwangwol Lounge)

574
01:21:08,132 --> 01:21:11,867
- I do not think I can do anything.
- I do not think so.

575
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:15,217
-Excuse me
- Oh, did you come?

576
01:21:15,366 --> 01:21:20,031
- Mr. Ryosuke is here.
- I'm Aoi.

577
01:21:20,379 --> 01:21:22,642
It's been like this before.

578
01:21:24,068 --> 01:21:27,193
I did not really take it.

579
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,894
- Keep going.
-i See

580
01:21:29,963 --> 01:21:32,022
I do not really ...

581
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:38,163
I do not know what you're saying.

582
01:21:41,483 --> 01:21:43,952
My job is accounting.

583
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,902
I dream of work.

584
01:21:47,016 --> 01:21:50,393
I did not have a problem with what I did.

585
01:21:51,483 --> 01:21:55,242
- I'm so confident.
- It's not a problem at all.

586
01:21:56,565 --> 01:21:59,629
I've already stretched it like this.

587
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:01,788
- We did not get it.
-Yes, got it

588
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,887
- We have to bring men in. Can you do it?
- Yeah. It's okay.

589
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:08,216
- Then we'll go. I'm sorry.
-Thank you very much

590
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:10,149
It's no big deal.

591
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:12,300
Honey, get up.

592
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,181
The manager came down.

593
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:18,983
Look, look, look,

594
01:22:19,182 --> 01:22:24,287
- Because we can not move, we call our male colleagues.
- Come on, honey.

595
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:27,564
- I'll help you.
- Oh, would you?

596
01:22:27,947 --> 01:22:32,493
- Are you going to the hot springs?
- Oh, I'm thinking about it.

597
01:22:33,518 --> 01:22:37,121
- Well, then this is me.
- Excuse me for bothering you.

598
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:39,368
-Thanks for your work
- You should get an early rest.

599
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:42,696
Come on, get up.

600
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,047
- I'm screaming.
-try

601
01:23:11,095 --> 01:23:13,197
Please do yourself a favor.

602
01:23:14,151 --> 01:23:15,653
I'm really screaming.

603
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:18,792
Then your wife

604
01:23:19,214 --> 01:23:22,531
I'll see you get hit like this.

605
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,992
you

606
01:23:26,152 --> 01:23:30,025
-stop it
- There's no way I can help you.

607
01:23:31,483 --> 01:23:35,387
By the way, why are you wearing these clothes?

608
01:23:37,355 --> 01:23:39,371
You can change your schedule

609
01:23:39,935 --> 01:23:42,418
Did you even think about going back?

610
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:46,309
Is not that right? If it did

611
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,589
The prison is waiting.

612
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:54,263
Listen to me properly.

613
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:02,707
What are you doing?

614
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:06,122
I do not care.

615
01:24:10,476 --> 01:24:12,199
more

616
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,927
Make me feel good.

617
01:24:48,081 --> 01:24:50,407
You also want it.

618
01:24:53,945 --> 01:24:56,371
You have a strong sexual desire.

619
01:24:57,399 --> 01:24:59,359
No

620
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:26,692
Go closer.

621
01:25:33,692 --> 01:25:36,212
I'm really excited about this.

622
01:26:04,716 --> 01:26:07,714
The nipple is sensitive.

623
01:26:30,155 --> 01:26:31,957
I can not stand it.

624
01:26:50,337 --> 01:26:52,900
Next door

625
01:26:55,505 --> 01:26:58,067
What is this pantie

626
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,910
Wearing for me?

627
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:05,712
Yes?

628
01:27:06,782 --> 01:27:08,918
I do not like this.

629
01:27:57,699 --> 01:27:59,953
It was already wet.

630
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:04,297
In front of her husband

631
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,079
It's soaked.

632
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:41,896
Do you want me to put it in quickly?

633
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:46,254
In your hole

634
01:29:59,249 --> 01:30:01,278
I'll rub it like this.

635
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,803
Also

636
01:30:31,335 --> 01:30:33,959
It's already wet.

637
01:30:42,706 --> 01:30:45,421
I'll lick you now.

638
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:47,574
You like it?

639
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,909
Not excited

640
01:31:21,483 --> 01:31:26,326
I'm rubbing it with your panties.

641
01:33:00,379 --> 01:33:02,873
Feeling good?

642
01:33:03,533 --> 01:33:05,500
It feels good.

643
01:33:07,508 --> 01:33:09,699
it's not like that?

644
01:33:38,603 --> 01:33:40,650
You are obscene.

645
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:48,734
I'm sorry.

646
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,105
What is this

647
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:14,954
stop it

648
01:36:11,314 --> 01:36:13,414
Lick my nipples.

649
01:36:16,805 --> 01:36:19,291
Lick me with your hands moving.

650
01:36:25,128 --> 01:36:26,903
Yes, there it is.

651
01:36:32,248 --> 01:36:34,190
Good mood

652
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:37,243
I'll do it by hand.

653
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:42,060
Ok a little more

654
01:37:36,877 --> 01:37:38,353
more

655
01:38:05,759 --> 01:38:07,883
Now lick the balls

656
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:11,174
Lick properly with your tongue

657
01:38:20,408 --> 01:38:22,677
Good good..

658
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:28,573
How do you feel?

659
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,861
My husband is next to me

660
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:35,249
I feel like licking my balls

661
01:38:43,322 --> 01:38:45,242
It feels good.

662
01:38:47,226 --> 01:38:49,727
Make me feel better.

663
01:38:58,454 --> 01:39:00,691
Use your hands this time.

664
01:39:01,251 --> 01:39:03,725
Use it yourself.

665
01:39:09,037 --> 01:39:11,497
Do not you want to lose your life now?

666
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:13,990
So be good.

667
01:39:35,329 --> 01:39:37,515
Let me be a baby.

668
01:39:52,026 --> 01:39:55,211
It's so soft here, here.

669
01:39:56,672 --> 01:39:58,365
Take a look.

670
01:39:59,931 --> 01:40:01,421
Do it well.

671
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,162
Have you ever done this?

672
01:40:36,607 --> 01:40:38,477
It's a good teapot.

673
01:40:40,984 --> 01:40:43,461
Now lick again

674
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:52,579
By hand

675
01:40:52,869 --> 01:40:54,265
More violently

676
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:32,940
want?

677
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:52,937
It's sickening.

678
01:41:57,016 --> 01:41:59,246
I got stuck.

679
01:43:32,512 --> 01:43:34,313
It's getting wet.

680
01:43:37,016 --> 01:43:38,518
Come a little closer.

681
01:43:39,242 --> 01:43:40,980
No, stop it.

682
01:43:44,524 --> 01:43:46,341
Holding a face

683
01:44:09,148 --> 01:44:11,189
Really good

684
01:44:16,076 --> 01:44:17,989
driving me crazy

685
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:02,028
Come this way

686
01:45:26,309 --> 01:45:28,328
Good mood

687
01:46:02,662 --> 01:46:05,998
It's tight, it's tight.

688
01:46:50,075 --> 01:46:52,674
I like it.

689
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,590
Good mood

690
01:49:16,956 --> 01:49:18,690
So good

691
01:49:24,114 --> 01:49:26,017
I like it.

692
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:36,870
Did you feel good?

693
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:41,467
Your husband does not break.

694
01:50:44,594 --> 01:50:47,715
Take your husband back to the room.

695
01:52:43,151 --> 01:52:45,709
What are you doing?

696
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:51,971
Ryosuke, the manager is going to break.

697
01:52:52,893 --> 01:52:55,174
- Please stop.
-Quiet

698
01:52:58,024 --> 01:53:02,553
Ryosuke is there.

699
01:53:04,909 --> 01:53:06,535
No

700
01:53:10,289 --> 01:53:12,688
Sir, wait.

701
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:24,753
No, let me go.

702
01:53:27,532 --> 01:53:29,561
Let me go.

703
01:53:35,038 --> 01:53:36,834
I do not like it

704
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:02,241
- What is it?
-Do not do that

705
01:54:03,205 --> 01:54:05,505
Boss? what

706
01:54:06,204 --> 01:54:08,307
- What ... What?
- Stay still.

707
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:10,731
Why are you tied up?

708
01:54:14,758 --> 01:54:16,868
Do not do it.

709
01:54:19,358 --> 01:54:21,676
Towards her

710
01:54:22,605 --> 01:54:25,160
Because my feelings have exploded.

711
01:54:25,395 --> 01:54:27,828
- What are you talking about?
- A guy like you.

712
01:54:28,499 --> 01:54:31,903
She does not fit at all.

713
01:54:34,986 --> 01:54:36,765
what?

714
01:54:42,889 --> 01:54:45,324
- I'll show you.
- No, no.

715
01:54:54,746 --> 01:54:58,950
- This is the real look of your wife.
-What?

716
01:55:00,883 --> 01:55:02,796
No, no.

717
01:55:07,106 --> 01:55:08,543
What is this?

718
01:55:10,409 --> 01:55:11,890
No

719
01:55:14,564 --> 01:55:16,420
What the hell is this?

720
01:55:18,217 --> 01:55:19,958
Boss

721
01:55:21,859 --> 01:55:24,862
I can never send you to prison.

722
01:55:27,517 --> 01:55:29,230
So I asked him for help.

723
01:55:30,917 --> 01:55:33,012
- I told you.
- What are you talking about?

724
01:55:37,136 --> 01:55:39,118
Your body

725
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:42,367
I want you to be able to write for me.

726
01:55:42,706 --> 01:55:44,508
How can you say that?

727
01:55:45,077 --> 01:55:46,278
It's a good wife.

728
01:55:46,807 --> 01:55:47,941
By the way

729
01:55:48,688 --> 01:55:50,814
Rather than you

730
01:55:51,473 --> 01:55:54,679
I am more happy with her happiness

731
01:56:02,692 --> 01:56:05,643
- Wait, what are you doing?
-Boss

732
01:56:06,248 --> 01:56:08,478
No ... No.

733
01:56:15,139 --> 01:56:17,036
Stop it.

734
01:56:18,853 --> 01:56:20,805
Stick out your tongue

735
01:56:20,854 --> 01:56:22,695
- Listen to me.
-No

736
01:56:24,219 --> 01:56:26,381
Then both of you will be ruined.

737
01:56:27,275 --> 01:56:28,592
Tsukasa ..

738
01:56:29,175 --> 01:56:31,278
- Hold your tongue.
-I do not like it

739
01:56:31,978 --> 01:56:34,781
I can never believe that.

740
01:56:35,147 --> 01:56:36,964
I can not believe it.

741
01:56:37,774 --> 01:56:39,599
It's cute.

742
01:56:41,572 --> 01:56:44,275
Go ahead and stick it out like you used to.

743
01:56:51,766 --> 01:56:53,711
Stick out your tongue

744
01:57:04,294 --> 01:57:06,731
Honey, do not look.

745
01:57:08,192 --> 01:57:09,985
Do not look

746
01:57:17,407 --> 01:57:19,908
Tsu ... Tsukasa

747
01:57:27,733 --> 01:57:29,514
Not yet.

748
01:57:38,938 --> 01:57:41,837
What is your status now?

749
01:57:42,171 --> 01:57:43,672
You're already wet, are not you?

750
01:57:48,668 --> 01:57:50,096
Please stop

751
01:57:50,192 --> 01:57:52,334
I'll make you much more cute.

752
01:57:52,872 --> 01:57:54,674
You really like it.

753
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:57,354
Boss

754
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:58,633
No..

755
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:13,761
stop

756
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,657
Please stop

757
01:58:16,023 --> 01:58:18,173
What are you doing

758
01:58:19,369 --> 01:58:21,852
What are you really doing .. Please stop.

759
01:58:23,971 --> 01:58:26,216
Can you hear me?

760
01:58:28,614 --> 01:58:30,684
What is this

761
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:33,112
Stop it really!

762
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:36,168
It's really loud.

763
01:58:40,019 --> 01:58:41,711
awhile

764
01:58:44,814 --> 01:58:47,296
You are too noisy

765
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:49,762
I'm stuck.

766
01:58:53,202 --> 01:58:55,503
No, no.

767
01:58:58,501 --> 01:59:00,611
No!

768
01:59:01,883 --> 01:59:03,802
Let me go.

769
01:59:17,176 --> 01:59:19,579
It was so good that you could not stand it?

770
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:21,564
no

771
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,368
You got so wet.

772
01:59:39,922 --> 01:59:42,324
Not just touching

773
02:00:02,734 --> 02:00:05,167
Show me the drenched pussy.

774
02:00:10,109 --> 02:00:12,259
It's so wet.

775
02:00:12,743 --> 02:00:14,363
It's a big deal.

776
02:00:16,343 --> 02:00:19,242
No, stop it.

777
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:25,703
-no
- The milk's hard.

778
02:00:28,189 --> 02:00:30,054
It's getting wet.

779
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:56,899
It's a really good flesh.

780
02:00:58,663 --> 02:01:00,766
I've been wasting too much.

781
02:01:04,827 --> 02:01:07,554
I brought good gifts.

782
02:01:22,481 --> 02:01:25,952
Do not, do not.

783
02:01:29,989 --> 02:01:32,870
- It feels good.
-Do not do that

784
02:02:04,972 --> 02:02:08,089
So good? How much do you feel?

785
02:02:10,129 --> 02:02:11,493
In your head

786
02:02:11,667 --> 02:02:13,734
My head is dark.

787
02:02:14,495 --> 02:02:17,076
In the head .. in the head ..

788
02:02:18,691 --> 02:02:21,773
Both of you are on their way to destruction.

789
02:02:22,528 --> 02:02:24,741
They are fools.

790
02:02:27,302 --> 02:02:29,749
No, stop it.

791
02:02:32,222 --> 02:02:35,833
Just to be honest, I'm crazy about it.

792
02:02:55,146 --> 02:02:57,502
You have to be honest.

793
02:03:14,798 --> 02:03:16,445
Are you going now?

794
02:03:16,596 --> 02:03:18,401
Hold on.

795
02:03:25,758 --> 02:03:27,233
stop

796
02:03:28,007 --> 02:03:30,412
-stop
- Do you think?

797
02:03:33,947 --> 02:03:37,180
Show me how you never showed your husband.

798
02:03:39,647 --> 02:03:44,023
Are you watching now? Moving back on its own

799
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:47,294
I'm going?

800
02:03:48,136 --> 02:03:50,487
No ... stop it.

801
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:52,169
I'm going?

802
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:04,356
No

803
02:04:08,183 --> 02:04:09,986
You're on your way.

804
02:04:26,762 --> 02:04:28,785
It's gone.

805
02:05:03,697 --> 02:05:09,117
Stop it ... I can not ... Please stop.

806
02:05:11,404 --> 02:05:13,530
I'll give you another one.

807
02:05:13,888 --> 02:05:15,657
- How about this one?
-no no

808
02:05:15,979 --> 02:05:18,442
This ...

809
02:05:30,853 --> 02:05:33,160
Are you really killing me?

810
02:06:01,128 --> 02:06:03,367
Feeling good?

811
02:06:27,466 --> 02:06:29,609
No

812
02:06:30,410 --> 02:06:33,711
No no

813
02:06:38,112 --> 02:06:40,800
- Go ... go.
- You're going.

814
02:06:41,576 --> 02:06:42,980
Put it down.

815
02:06:45,762 --> 02:06:46,907
Goes..

816
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,487
Go, go

817
02:06:49,765 --> 02:06:52,014
Go away ..

818
02:07:05,725 --> 02:07:07,971
Thanks

819
02:07:08,067 --> 02:07:10,411
I found this woman.

820
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:12,872
It's Danney.

821
02:07:26,349 --> 02:07:28,531
Stop it.

822
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:40,574
stop..

823
02:07:47,511 --> 02:07:50,305
You know how to pick up your nigga?

824
02:07:50,512 --> 02:07:54,352
I see your bride getting so horny.

825
02:07:54,951 --> 02:07:56,664
What a nonsense.

826
02:07:58,878 --> 02:08:00,376
Yes?

827
02:08:13,332 --> 02:08:15,282
Lick me

828
02:08:23,503 --> 02:08:25,225
Lick me

829
02:08:39,172 --> 02:08:41,339
You better be good.

830
02:08:47,527 --> 02:08:49,948
For the hip

831
02:08:57,541 --> 02:08:59,377
Enjoy together

832
02:09:11,785 --> 02:09:14,059
Please continue.

833
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:26,628
You can not move.

834
02:09:27,466 --> 02:09:29,080
stop

835
02:09:33,479 --> 02:09:36,068
I'll get the inside out.

836
02:09:38,461 --> 02:09:40,072
stop

837
02:09:43,318 --> 02:09:46,321
There's no other way than going on.

838
02:09:47,887 --> 02:09:50,016
Okay, from now on

839
02:09:50,636 --> 02:09:52,455
Suck my cock

840
02:09:59,194 --> 02:10:01,297
I can suck my stuff.

841
02:10:19,481 --> 02:10:21,487
You can wash anything.

842
02:10:24,524 --> 02:10:26,459
It's what you like.

843
02:10:48,781 --> 02:10:50,925
Suck it up with your mouth

844
02:11:00,677 --> 02:11:03,319
You do not have the right to deny it.

845
02:11:04,378 --> 02:11:06,267
-right
-nevertheless

846
02:11:31,323 --> 02:11:33,168
Look good

847
02:11:45,176 --> 02:11:47,507
We have to do it until rice.

848
02:11:50,573 --> 02:11:51,886
Use your hands.

849
02:11:52,929 --> 02:11:54,659
As usual

850
02:11:59,494 --> 02:12:01,314
Oh, you did it.

851
02:12:18,167 --> 02:12:20,707
Oh, I've had enough erection.

852
02:12:41,187 --> 02:12:44,655
Use your hands to lick me wildly

853
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,494
It looks like it is now.

854
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:21,685
It looks like rice.

855
02:13:26,101 --> 02:13:28,316
Show me the wrap.

856
02:13:30,573 --> 02:13:33,454
In this situation,

857
02:13:33,567 --> 02:13:35,565
Is your hair strange?

858
02:13:39,677 --> 02:13:41,784
Suck

859
02:14:14,994 --> 02:14:16,789
Oh, good.

860
02:14:22,747 --> 02:14:25,426
It's especially good today.

861
02:14:27,717 --> 02:14:30,056
I'm so happy.

862
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:38,212
Keep going, lick the balls.

863
02:14:45,932 --> 02:14:48,635
Lick the pussy.

864
02:14:55,656 --> 02:14:58,614
Faster and faster

865
02:15:02,142 --> 02:15:04,358
With your hands

866
02:15:17,899 --> 02:15:19,877
Okay, very good.

867
02:15:34,133 --> 02:15:36,694
Now get down.

868
02:15:44,644 --> 02:15:46,887
Let's put it

869
02:16:09,433 --> 02:16:11,878
I got sick.

870
02:16:16,015 --> 02:16:18,130
Is this much bigger and cheerful?

871
02:16:19,114 --> 02:16:20,915
Do not

872
02:16:38,429 --> 02:16:40,634
It's huge.

873
02:16:45,202 --> 02:16:47,604
Looks like it's a waste for you.

874
02:17:11,588 --> 02:17:15,418
Go upstairs.

875
02:17:17,805 --> 02:17:19,495
show me

876
02:17:43,625 --> 02:17:45,727
You are so violently stuck

877
02:17:46,736 --> 02:17:48,243
Would you wrap it up?

878
02:17:48,492 --> 02:17:49,869
No

879
02:17:50,302 --> 02:17:52,544
I feel great right now

880
02:17:53,132 --> 02:17:55,848
All right, move it, move it.

881
02:18:06,353 --> 02:18:08,393
Grace ~ kills

882
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:15,728
stop

883
02:18:47,281 --> 02:18:48,932
in action

884
02:18:51,027 --> 02:18:54,030
All right, all right.

885
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:06,976
driving me crazy

886
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:14,198
My cock acknowledges a much better one.

887
02:19:14,504 --> 02:19:15,980
you too

888
02:19:17,294 --> 02:19:19,371
Deeper

889
02:19:19,538 --> 02:19:21,205
A little more

890
02:19:21,364 --> 02:19:23,308
Let's enjoy sex

891
02:19:24,407 --> 02:19:26,258
Put it deep.

892
02:19:31,412 --> 02:19:33,730
Go ahead a little bit more.

893
02:19:46,986 --> 02:19:49,246
bite

894
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:56,191
If you do not cheat quickly, you will continue.

895
02:20:33,776 --> 02:20:36,013
Good.

896
02:20:48,254 --> 02:20:50,105
More aggressively

897
02:21:02,013 --> 02:21:03,767
Faster

898
02:21:30,857 --> 02:21:34,349
Now show me, you're wrapped up

899
02:21:35,859 --> 02:21:38,296
Move a bit more violently.

900
02:21:40,313 --> 02:21:42,178
More violently

901
02:21:44,364 --> 02:21:45,866
Is it like rice?

902
02:21:46,373 --> 02:21:47,936
Wrap, wrap

903
02:21:48,595 --> 02:21:51,219
Come out, come out.

904
02:21:53,116 --> 02:21:54,742
Wrap

905
02:22:07,171 --> 02:22:09,271
Please clean it.

906
02:22:30,798 --> 02:22:33,019
Stop it.

907
02:22:47,806 --> 02:22:49,785
Feeling good?

908
02:23:09,654 --> 02:23:12,357
- It's coming out.
-No

909
02:23:28,129 --> 02:23:30,566
I go.

910
02:23:31,043 --> 02:23:32,386
Ah, I'm going.

911
02:23:32,593 --> 02:23:34,949
Go ~~~

912
02:23:54,892 --> 02:23:56,138
No

913
02:23:56,836 --> 02:23:58,440
Good mood

914
02:24:05,608 --> 02:24:07,498
Good mood?

915
02:24:42,481 --> 02:24:43,802
Good

916
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:46,254
In front of your husband

917
02:24:47,836 --> 02:24:49,098
I'll wrap it up.

918
02:24:50,637 --> 02:24:52,393
In the mouth of four years

919
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:02,979
I'll be great.

920
02:25:39,254 --> 02:25:40,938
I feel good.

921
02:25:48,980 --> 02:25:50,440
Honey

922
02:25:53,617 --> 02:25:55,688
What is going on

923
02:26:05,307 --> 02:26:06,991
then

924
