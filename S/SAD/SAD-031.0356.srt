1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,770
Kirara... are you in pain?

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,170
Naraku's toxins are still
inside your system.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,310
An herbal antidote?

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,050
Old Myoga, will Kirara recover
if she takes it?

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,110
Yes... Supposedly, not far from here,
is a village with an herb farm.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,480
But this herb farm is protected
by a demon.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,780
I wonder if you can take
the herb easily or not.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,450
'Kay, this is where Inuyasha comes in.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,590
Beat up this demon and
get some of the herbs.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,130
Kirara actually took a bite
of Naraku.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,860
Unlike Myoga, Kirara has gumption!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,260
It's the least I can
do for her.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,160
Unlike Myoga, we can count on
Kirara's strength in battle.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,900
She must make a full recovery.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,440
Oh, guys! What're you saying?

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,340
Old Myoga has been a big help
to us.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,450
For example...

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,940
Well...

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,920
H-hey!

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,490
I let you do the talking...

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,350
and you all decide that
I'm small and useless!

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,760
Physical prowess isn't the only
criteria for achievement!

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,020
Give me some credit for
having intelligence!

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,030
I see... Inuyasha went to
get herbal medicine for me.

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,260
Yes, and I stayed back
to protect you.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,610
So put your mind at ease
and rest.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,980
Yes?

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,480
I got the feeling
it's even more dangerous here.

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,450
Don't worry, Sango.

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,390
Kagome told me to watch
so Miroku won't do anything funny.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,420
I'm here, too!

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,540
I think it's faster if
I went alone.

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,550
Old Kaede taught me how to
pick the correct herbs.

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,110
I may hold you back a bit,
but that's okay, isn't it...

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,150
if I came to see this
herb garden.

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,190
Oh well then...
I'm counting on ya.

37
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,460
It's been so long since
we were alone.

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,730
At first, just the two of us searched
for the Sacred Jewel fragments.

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,340
But now we're all together.

40
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,800
Fighting the demons is hard work...

41
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,640
but it's nice to have lots
of friends.

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,810
He's fallen asleep.
He must be exhausted.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,450
I guess...during the battle
with Naraku...

44
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,280
he was under so much pressure.

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,620
Let him sleep... Be quiet...

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,160
Quiet...

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,120
Hey!

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Are you still upset that
I dropped you from the bike?

49
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,990
I said I'm sorry.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,680
Will you pipe down!
I said I'm not angry!

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,690
Huh? What?

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,760
Isn't it fun being with me?

53
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,900
Huh? What're you saying?!

54
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,360
You've been grouchy
the whole time!

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
Err... Stupid!

56
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,660
I was born like this!

57
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,280
Just when we're all alone...

58
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,810
Huh? What's that?

59
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,950
Huh?

60
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,080
She's the third victim.

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,450
I wonder if it is the work
of Jinenji.

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,920
Of course! That monster!
We can't let him get away with this!

63
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,720
B-but... what'll we do?

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,230
Is this Jinenji a demon?

65
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,930
W-who are you?!

66
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,970
A demon!

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,200
Umm... this person does fall
into that category, but...

68
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,270
Huh?!

69
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,580
No! He won't harm you.

70
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,640
We're just looking for a farm to
get some medicinal herbs.

71
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,950
Medicinal herbs?

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,610
From Jinenji's farm?

73
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,120
That's the farm of the demon
who killed the woman!

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,350
Jinenji is a huge demon who
lives with his mother...

75
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,890
on the edge of our village.

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,690
He has a farm of very
effective medicinal herbs.

77
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,130
We used to go to get
herbs once in a while...

78
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,070
But lately, Jinenji's gotten a
hankering for human flesh.

79
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,710
That's Jinenji.

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,340
Doesn't he look fierce?

81
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,280
He's just big, that's all.

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,310
Hey you... are you really
going to slay him?

83
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,720
Yea... in addition to
getting the herbs.

84
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,220
- Kagome, wait here.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,020
Is that boy strong?

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,560
Who cares? It's a battle
between demons.

87
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,860
Doesn't matter which
one dies.

88
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,460
I don't feel good about them...

89
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,370
Are you the cannibalistic demon?

90
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,630
I'm gonna kill you,
so prepare yourself!

91
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,650
Huh?

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
Hmm? He doesn't smell
of human blood.

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,250
Huh?!

94
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,790
- Hey Jinenji!
- Prepare to die!

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,430
Ma!

96
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,360
Ma!

97
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,490
Huh?

98
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,830
Wait!

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,300
Help!

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,370
Why you...!

101
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,770
A mountain witch!

102
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,500
How dare you make up excuses
to take away my fields!

103
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,310
The kid's down!

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,450
So weak!

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,050
What's with them?

106
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,350
I don't know what
those villagers put you up to...

107
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,090
but this child would never
eat people! Never!

108
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,060
Picking on him because
he's a half-demon!

109
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,290
Half-demon?

110
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,880
You there... Inuyasha?

111
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,420
You are a half-demon, aren't you?

112
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,440
Can you tell, crone?

113
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,680
You're good-looking
for a half-demon.

114
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,690
But no matter what,
you're just half of one.

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,660
Half? I guess that's
around here, huh?

116
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,630
You can understand what
it's like.

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,500
Just because my Jinenji
is a half-demon...

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,630
how much we have suffered at
the hands of those villagers.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,910
You mean, he's bullied?

120
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,810
Hah! They've tried to kill
him so many times.

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,280
Sorry Ma... they bully you
cuz' of me.

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,350
What are you saying?

123
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,460
We have done nothing wrong!

124
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,720
Your father was a fine,
good demon.

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,130
Such memories I have...

126
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,790
I sprained my ankle in
the mountain and couldn't walk.

127
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,110
It was your father who saved me.

128
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,000
He was in the form of
a handsome man...

129
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,750
but I knew immediately
that he was a demon.

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,940
Because he was bathed
in light.

131
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,880
And we fell passionately
in love.

132
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,330
Just a minute, crone...

133
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,520
That means you're the human?

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,330
What did you think I was?

135
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,530
She's not a witch.

136
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,870
An antidote.

137
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,860
If someone is poisoned,
prepare this potion.

138
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,680
T-thanks.

139
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,770
How much do we owe?

140
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,980
Never mind.

141
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,080
We're even now... for the
clubbing I gave him earlier.

142
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,680
Now go.

143
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,790
If you stay, you'll get caught up!

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
Inuyasha...

145
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,730
is it okay to leave them?

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,730
Whaddya mean?

147
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,700
The villagers believe that
Jinenji eats people.

148
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,870
Jinenji is big in size,
but he seems very gentle.

149
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,640
That's why he's picked on.

150
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,140
When you're born a half-demon...

151
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,310
you need to be prepared
and you need to be tough.

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,190
Gather every sword and spear
in the village!

153
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,430
This'll do!

154
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,260
We can beat Jinenji
with these!

155
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,530
We must kill him before
he kills us!

156
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,630
Tonight! We'll settle it tonight!

157
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,070
Just a minute!

158
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,930
What? It's you!

159
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,370
You intend to attack Jinenji?

160
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,700
Of course!

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,670
But you have no proof that
he killed anyone!

162
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,900
It has to be him!

163
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,150
That hag and her son
resent us!

164
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,380
They're just getting
back at us!

165
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,150
Hey you...

166
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,850
you've been awfully cruel
to Jinenji, haven't you?

167
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,850
Huh?

168
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,060
Well anyway, unless the
real flesh-eating demon is caught...

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,660
this won't be resolved.

170
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,660
Real flesh-eating demon?

171
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,060
You're gonna capture it?

172
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,400
Inuyasha, I'm going back
to the farm.

173
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,560
Kagome!

174
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,340
So until Inuyasha returns,
please don't attack Jinenji.

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,470
If I should get caught up and hurt...

176
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,050
this Inuyasha will wreak
havoc in the village!

177
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,340
Huh? What?!

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,520
Why not? You'd better wreak havoc!
You have to!

179
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,480
W-well... I guess I can...

180
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,450
What is this kid?

181
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,950
He doesn't seem reliable.

182
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,270
The murdered woman had the
smell of a demon on her.

183
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,000
I can smell it...
it's nearby!

184
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,770
- The villagers did?
- Yes.

185
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,140
So until Jinenji's innocence
is proven, I'll help out here.

186
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,810
As you please.

187
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,380
I just pull out the weeds?

188
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,820
Y-yes...

189
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,650
So many scars...

190
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,760
The villagers must have
inflicted them.

191
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,430
Say, didn't you ever think
about leaving here?

192
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,430
This place is best...
My pa left us this farm.

193
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,500
I see...

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,810
I- I'm speaking to her...

195
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,110
For the first time in my life,
I spoke to a girl!

196
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,890
An earthworm!

197
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,320
Thanks...

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,620
She's scared of earthworms,
but she's not afraid of Jinenji?

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,730
Look!

200
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,770
Ahh...is this what it's like
to have fun?

201
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,080
It's around here.
I'm sure of it.

202
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,450
The earth...

203
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,320
Are you beneath this?!

204
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,790
Aw... Ouch...

205
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,490
What is this place?

206
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
These are eggs!

207
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,650
And they've just hatched.

208
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,890
I see... this is a demon's nest!

209
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,360
No! The parent demon has taken
her brood out!

210
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,870
What'll they do?

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,970
It's obvious!

212
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,090
She's taken her newborn to teach
them how to hunt humans!

213
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,340
Kagome is in danger!

214
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,340
Shall we do it?

215
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,550
We needn't worry.

216
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,210
Only Jinenji eats human!

217
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,920
We can't trust that other
half-demon kid!

218
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
What am I feeling?

219
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,730
When I'm with this girl,
I feel a warmth in my heart.

220
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,870
Come on out, Jinenji!

221
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,740
We know you're the
one who killed our people!

222
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,530
You rotten half-demon!

223
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,880
Old woman!

224
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,040
Those men!

225
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,510
Ma!

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,110
Don't worry.
Stay put!

227
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,920
Why you...!

228
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,350
You ingrate!

229
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,510
After we let you live near
our village!

230
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,320
Stop!

231
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,590
Are you all right?

232
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,260
- Move, girl!
- Why try to protect them?!

233
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,900
Jinenji can't kill anyone!

234
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,330
If you stayed with him,
you'd see that immediately!

235
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,700
Jinenji is a kind and gentle person!

236
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,400
Never mind! Kill the girl too!

237
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,650
She was in cahoots with
that half-demon boy anyway!

238
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,940
She's one of them!

239
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,110
The hut!

240
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,990
Why you...!

241
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,890
Tago's been seized by
a giant demon!

242
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,800
The larvae are eating Tago!

243
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,500
They're gonna eat us!

244
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,730
You see?! They're the one
who ate the villagers!

245
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,250
I have to do something!
Anything!

246
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,190
Jinenji, run outside!

247
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,420
Stay with your mother!

248
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,600
Ma!

249
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,670
I got it!

250
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,020
Stop!

251
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,200
Jinenji!

252
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,010
Jinenji!

253
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,600
Hurry and get away!

254
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,600
You were the only one...
who treated me like a human!

255
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,440
If I let you die here...

256
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,190
I won't be able to
live with myself!

257
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,550
Jinenji!

258
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,550
Jinenji...!

259
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,000
H-help!

260
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,420
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!

261
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,900
Kagome!
Where are you?!

262
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,040
Inuyasha!

263
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,100
Save Jinenji!

264
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't help him!

265
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't interfere!

266
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,650
Jinenji must fight alone!

267
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,610
Why?!

268
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,890
Old woman... So that's it.

269
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,690
What're you sneaking around for?!

270
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,190
I see... you were up to no good again,
weren't you?

271
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,790
W-we're sorry!

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,090
- We'll never do anything again!
- Please spare us!

273
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,930
Please!

274
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,670
Hah! You grovel before
the strong...

275
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,670
Better say sorry to him, too!

276
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,870
Jinenji! Show 'em just
how strong you are!

277
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,780
Amazing!

278
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,290
W-we're sorry we suspected you!
Please don't kill us!

279
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,630
Well, now the villagers
should behave...

280
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,490
Say! Everyone's shaking
in fear!

281
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,760
Good for them! No way are they
gonna be friends.

282
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,410
So it's better to make it clear
who's stronger.

283
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,740
But...!

284
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,480
Sorry!

285
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,180
We'll never torment you again!
Forgive us!

286
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,820
Um...

287
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,220
Huh?

288
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,220
You're all hurt.

289
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,180
This will help heal
your wounds.

290
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,730
Jinenji...!

291
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,990
Aw man...!

292
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,770
Ma... are you all right?

293
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,870
Jinenji... You...!

294
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,900
If this is how you want it,
that's fine with me.

295
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,650
Will you really be all right?

296
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,380
Yeah... you need to take the
medicinal herbs to your friend.

297
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,790
Hurry and be on your way.

298
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,620
Okay.

299
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,230
Well then, Jinenji!

300
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,400
We'll be going now.

301
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,960
A-all right...

302
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,570
Good bye.

303
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you for everything.

304
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,930
Yes.

305
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,400
We're the ones who
should be thanking you.

306
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay, Jinenji.
Cheer up!

307
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,510
We have to tend to
our trampled fields.

308
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,340
Yeah.

309
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,480
Umm...

310
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,820
We'll help.

311
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,350
As you wish.

312
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,930
Say...

313
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,060
Huh?

314
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,170
Did that happen to you, too, Inuyasha?

315
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,800
Like what?

316
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,170
Well... like bullying...

317
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,270
Hah! Stupid!

318
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,270
No way I'd have taken it
lying down!

319
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,440
Oh, you're right.

320
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,980
He was bullied.

321
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm neither one nor the other.

322
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,150
Huh?

323
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm not a demon...
nor am I human.

324
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,820
I don't belong to either.

325
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,430
So... I always believed that...

326
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,050
I had to create my place
in life through power.

327
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,600
That's how I lived
and then I realized...

328
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,340
I was all alone.

329
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,630
That was the only way
I knew how to live.

330
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,970
Inuyasha... I...

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,270
You've made me happy.

332
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,720
Happy?!

333
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,680
It's the first time you've
opened up to me.

334
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,210
I wanted to know...

335
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,920
about your sad times...
the rough times...

336
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,390
about your feelings and your thoughts.

337
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,720
I'm glad that you talked to
me seriously.

338
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,160
That makes you happy?

339
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,170
Uh-huh... So sometimes, you can
show me your weak side.

340
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,330
Hah! You make it sound like
I was whining just now!

341
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,540
So what? You're not alone anymore.

342
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,050
Not alone?

343
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,420
Not alone?

344
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,690
Yeah...

345
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,020
before I knew it...
and yet so naturally...

346
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,720
Kagome is by my side.

347
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,090
A strange mountain shrouded
in a miasma.

348
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,530
The screeches of demons reverberate
to the base of the mountain.

349
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,190
Inuyasha is pulled into the cave
by some force.

350
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,100
Giant demons begin to
fuse with each other!

351
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,760
If Inuyasha keeps fighting
like this...

352
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,200
he will become a
part of the demon!

353
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,540
Kikyo...

354
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,280
are you going to...
help Inuyasha?

355
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,110
Next on Inuyasha,
"Kikyo and Inuyasha, Into the Miasma!"

356
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,220
Don't miss it!
