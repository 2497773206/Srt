1
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,840
Well done. Thanks. Good job!

2
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Do your best in the next match!

3
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,620
Kirara, my life is on the line.

4
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm cheering for you! I will not loose.

5
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,180
Hello.

6
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,840
It's me. In the next title match, won't you loose for us?

7
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,620
Ah.

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Well, you see. The next match is... I'm sorry.

9
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,100
Kirara, Kojima... is dead.

10
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,180
It happened all of a sudden.

11
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,280
The day before the important match.

12
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,060
My very important boyfriend.

13
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Was killed in the gym by someone.

14
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,600
He's got no enemies... WHY!?

15
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,520
Why, would this happen!?

16
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,220
The sadness of the gyms lost future fighting master,

17
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,320
Coupled with the promise of staying with him.

18
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,880
Crying over him. I was at a loss.

19
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,480
Uh, You're Kirara right?

20
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,100
Who are you?

21
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,220
What happened here,

22
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,140
I'm at a loss.

23
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,960
This is who I am.

24
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Fighting Association Chairman Joe Oshima

25
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,840
Are you someone important from the tournament?

26
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,820
I'm so sorry that this has happened to Kojima.

27
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,420
No, no. Kirara...

28
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:31,060
No, this guy is in the worst predicament.

29
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,600
Thank you so much for caring.

30
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,140
Why would such a thing happen? I'm mortified.

31
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,120
But he's got no enemies.

32
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,260
Even thought the facts are right before our eyes,

33
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,460
The situation is quite intense now.

34
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,840
Please cheer up Kirara.

35
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,240
Without fail, without fail, the partner who killed Kojima. I will...

36
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,340
The, partner, who killed... You know who killed him?!

37
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,980
Please calm down. Don't tell me to calm down!

38
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,800
If you know who killed him then you know why he was killed!

39
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,160
It doesn't matter why he was killed it's unacceptable!

40
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,180
Positively, with all my might.

41
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,340
Understood.

42
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:06,720
Please calm down Kirara, I'll tell you everything.

43
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Now, I finally learned the truth about Kojima's death.

44
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,700
Oshima said that,

45
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,160
The promoter told Kojima to take the fall in the title match.

46
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,480
Kojima was too serious so, ???

47
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,300
And the promoter hired someone to kill him.

48
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,800
If that's the reason that someone would be killed.

49
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,660
I didn't believe that lousy reason from the start.

50
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,100
However the stupid match fixing fighting association...

51
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,400
Planed to throw the title match.

52
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,100
As I listened puzzled to Oshima calmly tell me the story I didn't think he was lying.

53
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,280
As I listed further, the hatred for who killed him welled up.

54
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,080
The person who killed my darling will not be forgiven!

55
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,600
It's allowable to accept that reason.

56
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,220
It's very sad, but it's reality Kirara.

57
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,940
I was also involved with the underground.

58
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,680
However, we got our own rules.

59
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,460
Certainly, we will return the favor.

60
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,480
What should I do...

61
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,980
What do you mean Mr.Oshima? I want to do something! Let me help!

62
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,380
Tell me what to do!

63
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,160
Please calm down Kirara.

64
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:20,080
If we do something... because we're professionals.

65
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,380
There's nothing more you need to do.

66
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:34,220
Mr.Oshima, don't turn away from me. There's nothing to do now, I get it.

67
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,780
But after that, tell me!

68
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,620
Alright Kirara.

69
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,960
From one professional to another you see, listen up.

70
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Are you prepared?

71
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:02,180
Ready? Yea, I'm more than ready! Hurry up and tell me!

72
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,700
No police, no lawyers.

73
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,600
We've got project specialists to resolve the matter.

74
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,740
See, I'm here so, I've got lots of connections.

75
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,820
So, please leave it to me. I won't so anything strange.

76
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
A secret organization.

77
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:41,100
What do you mean? If that's true please introduce them to me. I want to do something!

78
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,540
Is that so? All by yourself?

79
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,720
I see.

80
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,160
What are you saying!? I'm serious!

81
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,020
I want use any power that I can.

82
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,520
Tell me, hey! Mr Oshima!

83
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:12,320
understood, I... have another business card.

84
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,920
Crackdown Enforcement Officer Joe Oshima

85
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,320
Mr.Oshima is a member of the secret organization.

86
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,300
I don't know... it's incomprehensible!

87
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,460
Tell me, What are you?

88
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,100
That business card says it all.

89
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,340
I have confidence in the secret organization.

90
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:05,980
It would please me to get help from you.

91
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,100
Well, I have an idea of who did this.

92
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,680
They know that I know.

93
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm in a between a rock and a hard place.

94
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,120
Mr.Oshima Please tell me!

95
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,400
Give me the knowledge I need.

96
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,400
You know it's a secret organization.

97
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,300
What are you doing!? Stop that.

98
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,740
My lover should be my partner right?

99
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Of course if you don't, the info you need...

100
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,000
Perhaps is a gun!?

101
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,240
Which I can use freely.

102
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,600
You just told me that you want to join.

103
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,620
Because I can't act yet, I'll have you do it.

104
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,580
Let's talk to each other.

105
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,280
You see, You've got a secret that you can't tell anyone!

106
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Shall we die with him!?

107
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,720
Alright get up, Stand!

108
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,860

109
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,620
Don't move.

110
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
Very nice.

111
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,500
You should take them off. Everything.

112
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,020
Got it. NOW, take it all off!

113
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,420
Respond.

114
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,880
Alright.

115
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,180
Go.

116
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,620
Don't try anything.

117
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,780
If you try anything... Bang!

118
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,200
Nice panties.

119
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,100
Got it!?

120
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,760
Hurry.

121
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm hard already!

122
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,580
Turn around.

123
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,260
NO, no.

124
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,880
Let's make it better.

125
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,820
I don't even need a gun to kill you, I could use my hands. Got it?

126
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,900
OK, Open your mouth.

127
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,940
Open.

128
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:05,020
No, Open! From now on you're my lover. Let's start acting like it!

Remove it!

Wonderful.

135
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,840
Your boyfriend should have been very happy!

136
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,220
What a hot body.

137
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,920
Don't touch me!

138
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,760
That's right.

139
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,040
You'll give it up. NO! What!?

140
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,380
Hey, look here. Ready for more?

141
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
No way! No!

142
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,720
Shut up! Don't tell me no!

143
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,540
Come on.

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,960
Give it to me!

147
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,800
Don't be humiliated.

148
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
It's for you, and for him.

I said more!

157
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,620
Are you enjoying it?

158
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,720
On your knees.

159
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,260
Open up.

160
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,640
Come on, open it.

That's it.

166
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,560
Come on.

167
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,460
Remember what I said, let's go.

168
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,960
I want you to use what you got ok.

169
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,360
Squeeze it, now!

Put your shoulder down.

175
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,060
You're ready.

176
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,720
Look interested.

177
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
Do it.

178
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,940
Wonderful, this hot body.

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,320
Now I want you to lye down, lye down.

00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,720
Yea, come here.

181
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,080
Open your legs, look here.

182
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,420
Just right.

183
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,780
So nasty.

184
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,940
Open up for me.

185
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,640
After Mr.Oshima raped me at gunpoint.

I Joined and got myself a gun!

01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,120
Could be worse.

365
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:45,560

01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,780
Yea, that's it.

375
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,980
I'm gonna cum.

376
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,680
You'll get it.

01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,320

380
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:19,180
Say something, say it! NO!

381
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,180

382
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,480
Still won't say it?

383
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,120
Look here.

384
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,260

01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,380

You can do it.

01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,100
Come on, what's the matter? Hey.

402
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,460
There's another dick.

01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,580
Hey, come on. What?

404
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,100
Look at it.

405
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,000

406
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,120

Come on. Hey! Come on.

I'm in!

410
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,060
Come on, huh?!

411
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,300
Here, come here.

412
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,400
Ass, now!

413
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,440
NO!

414
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,060
Hey.

415
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,380
Together now.

416
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,220
Move yourself!

417
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:04,720
Moar!

418
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,980
Hey, come on! Yea!

419
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,760
You feel good? Hey, look here. Come on.

Hey.

421
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:03,840
Open up.

422
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,340
Open more!

423
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,000
Hey!

424
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,660
Hey, Move it!

425
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,400
Yea!

426
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,720
Not done yet.

427
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,660
What's is it?

428
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,320
Nice and slow.

429
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,500
We might have to kill you.

430
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:57,820
Feels great.

431
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:10,980
She's got it. This is the last. Yea!

432
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,840
Squeeze it tight.

433
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,960
Very nice.

434
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,200
Feels great.

435
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,200
Hey

436
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:05,780
The last time you'll ever have sex. Hey!

437
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,160
No!

438
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:27,960
Say it! It feels good! It... is good... NO!

439
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:33,380
Don't say no! You know it's good. Come on!

440
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,280
Feels good.

441
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,040
You're the best. NO!

442
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,200
I'm gonna cum.

443
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,800
Oh! That's good.

444
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,440
Hows that?

445
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:20,980
Yea, the last time... you'll ever have sex...

446
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,500
Let's end it.

447
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,540
Hey, Tamaki.

448
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:06,700
I'll kill here alone.

449
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,060
You can leave. NO, I'll help ya!

450
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:16,160
It's alright, you can go!

451
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:23,560
Yea, but... Tamaki, go home! Got it, later.

452
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,240
So, what the hell do you know?

453
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:42,780
What... You know.

454
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,700
Mr.Oshima told me all about you.

455
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:55,220
I heard about you & that organization.

456
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:00,400
Are you joking, what the hell are you saying!?

457
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,100
So, someone here killed him!

458
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:08,940
I know that he didn't want to participate in the final fight.

459
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:12,220
That's why I'm here.

460
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:16,760
I see, but let's be honest.

461
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:24,660
It's just me and you so let's not worry about Mr.Oshima,

462
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:31,640
But he was right about you, very thoughtful.

463
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:35,720
Huh!? Why?!

464
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,640
I'm on your side!

465
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,240
I don't what's what now.

466
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:55,080
Quickly, I gotta get them now!

467
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,220
Oh, what the hell!?

468
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:31,800
You're the one!

469
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:50,520
I lost a ton of money! I lost more than that!

470
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:57,200
That bastard didn't give us the correct info!

471
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,140
Oh, huh?

472
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,840
Ouch.

473
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,980
Where the...

474
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,320
You know well.

475
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:24,840
Hey you! You're the one! Who shot them!?

476
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,340
Why the hell are you really here?

477
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,200
Say something. Tell us!

478
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,120
Shut up! Bring the boss out!

479
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:47,000
WTF!? We'll fucking kill you!

480
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:55,040
Don't get too excited.

481
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:57,840
Yea I guess.

482
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:05,080
Sorry fellas, I was just...

483
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,760
I do anything.

484
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:22,140
What's she saying? Do anything?

485
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:25,560
Don't believe you! Probably lying anyway...

486
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:31,440
At least you can undo the handcuffs.

487
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,900
I can't do anything if I can 't move.

488
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:39,360
So you, will do anything?

489
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,660
What will you do?

490
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,540
Careful!

491
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:54,400
Be careful, there's no need.

492
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,040
Besides, I've got an idea.

493
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,580
It might save your life.

494
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:36,080
Let's open it! Feels good.

495
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,480
Looks great!

496
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,620
Open up! Come here!

497
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,700
You try anything and your dead!

498
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,240
Hurry up and get them off!

499
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,720
That feels great!

500
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:26,420
Don't forget about me. Yea, him too!

501
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,180
Feels too good.

502
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:42,620
Let's get them out.

503
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:46,560
Me, first. No, Me.

504
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,420
Yea, that's great!

505
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:06,200
You really had a great idea!

506
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:26,880
She's really good. I want some too.

507
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,880
Oh, feels great!

508
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,240
That's it!

509
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:39,100
I'll get it out too.

510
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:00,100
She does it well.

511
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,060
Feels... so good!

512
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,460
Suck me off too!

513
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,960
Ah, feels good.

514
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,240
Feels good right?

515
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,240
From the young lady.

516
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,720
I'm waiting.

517
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:39,060
Good, oh! So good!

518
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,040
So good.

519
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,540
Suck me too!

520
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:12,580
Tasty dick? Mines the best!

521
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,920
Hey, wait... don't forget about me.

522
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,280
Feels good.

523
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:28,940
Why so skilled. I'm sure she gets around.

524
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:34,620
Should be happy with all these dicks!

525
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,820
Look at me!

526
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,660
She looks happy.

527
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:40,280
It's be nice if she gave it all up.

528
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,240
But feels so good!

529
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:19,820
You can do them both.

530
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:34,620
Such great tits!

531
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,800
Come here, gimme.

532
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,800
Feels good.

533
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,960
Oh, I'm gonna cum. Already!?

534
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,520
I'm gonna cum!

535
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:49,740
I'm gonna come on your tits!

536
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,520
Such a wonderful rack!

537
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,660
Hey... mumble, mumble.

538
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:31,820
Oh, I'm gonna cum!

539
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:45,060
That's a lotta cum! There's more!

540
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,320
Suck it.

541
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:55,080
Oh, I'm... gonna cum!

542
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,880
I'm gonna cum!

543
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:52,100
Here cums!

544
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:53,940
Gonna cum... here it cums!

545
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:34,980
She's great! Yea, that was awesome! Hey, WTF!?

546
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:36,340
Get in!

547
01:59:51,640 --> 02:00:03,520
Hey, What are you doing!? Stop it. Don't shoot!

548
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:17,700
It was unexpected that Kuroda was killed.

549
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:24,160
Well we got her, Mr. Agawa, from now...

550
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:29,880
We'll let our geeky Tamaki do it. Nah, not yet.

551
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:34,800
Our star is without a girlfriend.

552
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:41,400
He's a bit too serious so he can't promote.

553
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:46,580
Tamaki go study! OK!

554
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,420
We'll have you take care of a few things Tamaki.

555
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:55,380
Compared to now, there's much more on the other side.

556
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,420
Just like gambling!

557
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,100
Hey what are you doing!?

558
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,760
YOU!?

559
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:10,560
