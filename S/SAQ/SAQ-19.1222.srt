1
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,455
* LOUISIANA GENTLEMAN *

2
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,440
Henm...
He'll end up coming...

3
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,606
Aha...

4
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,568
Come on, aha...

5
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:48,369
When that does not
happen, it does not...

6
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,865
But everything is
going well, it's...

7
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,185
Come on down!

8
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:56,595
The street vendors
got there, they...

9
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:58,022
But I'm getting better.

10
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:00,392
Were there many sellers?

11
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:03,836
Yes, they had their samples:
Lace and leagues.

12
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,649
I was sure he could
find the queen.

13
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:09,329
But they earned me $
20 dollars like that!

14
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:12,205
They left me, the
letters that I train.

15
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,456
You will become a player!

16
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:17,957
I'll try the guy with me,
to make up for myself.

17
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,696
I can even start right away.

18
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,453
Aha, look.

19
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,426
Aha, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,076
Oho...

21
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:40,138
$ 20 dollars, you can
not find the queen.

22
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:42,264
Bet

23
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:55,540
No!
Hunm...

24
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:57,566
You're a pro.
Do not.

25
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:58,982
But I will become.

26
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,422
But you have to be.

27
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,740
You shuffle the cards
to perfection.

28
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,144
You're the first, not to complain.

29
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,833
What's your name?

30
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,009
Mark Fallon.
Is that you?

31
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,746
Polly, but they call
me Kansas John,

32
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,255
Except the money losers.

33
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:14,670
Ever heard of me?
Do not.

34
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:18,277
So you're not singing.
No, New York. Good.

35
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:19,646
You are a player?

36
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:20,864
More or less.

37
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,787
It was always playing in my
father's fencing school.

38
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,369
And I was the age to participate

39
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,249
Fencing between classes.
Hunm, hunm...

40
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,123
You look good, Mr. Fallon.

41
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:34,086
For such life bandit.
You are interested in?

42
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,421
This is not the case.
But you said...

43
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:38,563
I get another idea of the game, Mr.
Polly.

44
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,691
I am an honest person.

45
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:43,594
Will be back in this river.

46
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,205
You better deal with scoundrels.

47
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,727
Speaking of the devil...

48
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:56,206
In his place, I am suspicious of Mr.
Montague F. Caldwell.

49
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,001
You there!
Carry the suitcase on board!

50
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,193
Should we respectfully
follow his trail?

51
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,822
With your diamonds,
for any lighthouse!

52
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,683
How much do you put
in $ 600 dollars?

53
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,889
You have the courage!

54
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,113
Hey, slow down the horses!

55
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,183
Ohoo...

56
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:27,347
We are in time, dear brother.
I won my bet!

57
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,515
You are crazy!
You almost killed us!

58
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,916
You owe me $ 100 dollars and
a bottle that I offer you.

59
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,057
I have a lot of need!

60
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,428
Oho, oho...

61
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,980
Gently!
Ohoo...

62
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,558
Easy...
Hem !.

63
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,503
Thank you.

64
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,758
I saw you knock you down.

65
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,128
How nervous thoroughbred
needs softness.

66
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,193
Oh really?

67
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,496
It's been years since I've
driven pure-blooded nerves.

68
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,490
I do not do very well.

69
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,414
I have no doubt.

70
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,126
Horses and beautiful women,

71
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,655
Sometimes they are not
compatible with whistles.

72
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:33,258
You seem to be an expert on both.

73
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,958
Both interests me.

74
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,592
My sister does not care,
with her interests.

75
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:41,846
Looks good.

76
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:53,147
This little minx could
use a good spanking.

77
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,086
She does not make her horses.

78
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,521
With women, you never know...

79
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:03,113
$ 20, against $ 10,
which she returns.

80
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:06,202
Here's how I'm going
to repeat myself!

81
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,041
You are gifted.

82
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:56,182
It was pure luck.

83
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,739
I thought you had aces.

84
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,488
There is...

85
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,861
Sirs, may I join you?
With pleasure, sir.

86
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,153
The more, the better,
the more appropriate.

87
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,213
Excuse me.

88
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,457
You will find some high stakes.

89
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,154
That's what interests me.

90
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,685
Can we play with new cards?

91
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,661
Do you doubt them?

92
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,180
You may like to lose,

93
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,363
But I prefer opportunities
and balance.

94
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,889
You calling me a cheater?
Sirs, gentlemen!

95
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:34,937
If you must blame someone,
you will be mine, sir...

96
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,734
What is your name?

97
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,060
Mark Fallon, Mr. Caldwell.

98
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,334
I ordered these new
bartender cards.

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,865
Bartender!
Yes sir.

100
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,333
He set them on the table.

101
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,487
Sometimes bartenders are not aware

102
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,423
The quality of its customers.

103
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,286
Thank you sir.

104
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,488
Bartender!
What is this game?

105
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,086
What is the problem?

106
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,437
Mr. noticed that he was biased.

107
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:02,859
A cheater game!

108
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,322
Please believe me that I did not.

109
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,992
I do not care if you did not know!

110
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:11,055
If I see one of these games,
I report it to the captain!

111
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:14,168
Now let's bring, a
decent and sealed game!

112
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,429
Yes sir.

113
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,840
A letter.

114
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:24,796
I also had one.

115
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:27,411
Let's be unanimous, gentlemen.
A letter.

116
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:28,990
Check.

117
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,549
$ 300 dollars.

118
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,501
These are over 300.

119
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:03,493
I do not have enough in me.
I have to go.

120
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,331
Of course sir.

121
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,673
I can give you credit, Mr. Fallon.

122
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,085
I'm not playing the money
they do not have, Mr. Dureau.

123
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:16,433
We're not leaving, with $ 600 dollars.
Are you dry?

124
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,321
I have a hand, winning Mr. Polly.

125
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,985
Will you support me?

126
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,266
Should I get $ 600?
All right, sir.

127
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,637
And another 600.

128
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,406
900.
And I waited...

129
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,227
200.

130
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,502
To see.

131
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,422
To see.

132
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,352
A double of kings.

133
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:46,972
Color for the Queen.

134
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,392
Ten complete.

135
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,731
Thank you and good evening, sir.

136
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,270
It was not a good night for me!

137
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,326
Sorry for the wait.

138
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:08,462
You're welcome.
How much do I owe?

139
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,418
4100.
The bill is?

140
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,458
It's in big, over cover.

141
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,431
I'm not a liar.

142
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,558
It was estimated at
more than $ 7,000.

143
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,179
It's a family heirloom...

144
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:30,889
Its provenance is
not about anything!

145
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,547
Is debt covered?

146
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,527
Yes thanks.

147
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,390
You're back on the river.

148
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,004
Yes.
A very attractive life.

149
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:49,962
Do not you think,
that a long time...

150
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:54,148
If you repeat your
performance tonight.

151
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,784
We no longer have,
the right to win?

152
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,753
It is not supposed to ridicule a
player or question their cards.

153
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,326
We have a code of honor.

154
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,641
What kind of code is it, Mr.
Caldwell?

155
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:11,281
What we practice here, my dear.

156
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:14,524
The Mississippi waters are
turbulent, Mr. Fallon.

157
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,726
Many unlucky ones spent
overnight on board.

158
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,010
We never found the bodies.

159
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,184
Sleep well, sir.

160
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:27,192
Mr. Caldwell.

161
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:30,686
Tell these gentlemen

162
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:33,622
Which I plan to spend,
the time in Mississippi.

163
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,591
And everyone who will present
biased maps to my desk

164
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,453
Will be ejected from the game.

165
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:42,042
When this kind of shame
hits many men, sir,

166
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,184
They do not wait, to
fall off the boat.

167
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,582
They jump.

168
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,756
Good evening, sir.

169
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,408
Here we are condemned, to remain

170
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,381
In the best of New Orleans.

171
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:05,991
If luck follows us.

172
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:07,920
How long do you stop?

173
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,147
Two weeks.
And I'm dry.

174
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,201
As well?

175
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:14,538
I can not help but play even
though I know it's rigged.

176
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:16,523
The bad habit at my age.

177
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,350
Excuse me.
It would be less.

178
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,556
Miss Dureau.

179
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:42,549
Sorry to bother you, but your
brother missed last night.

180
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:44,772
And to you?

181
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,858
Yes.
I wanted to do it.

182
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,520
What does "a mistake" mean?

183
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,903
I beat him in letters.

184
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,903
He had drunk probably
did it all wrong...

185
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:00,909
My brother did not take
me without my permission.

186
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,113
I'm sure.

187
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,444
This is lovely...

188
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,742
But you have to be...
Mr. Fallon!

189
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,316
It's your name, I think.

190
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,257
I do not usually
talk to strangers.

191
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,229
And I do not accept
charity from a gambler.

192
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,364
Good morning, dear sister.

193
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,596
How dare you steal my necklace?

194
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:38,898
Your necklace? You gave this
player, he showed it to me.

195
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:41,626
I had no choice.
Because?

196
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:45,307
I was a fool.
I got ripped from last night.

197
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,381
They took all my
money, over $ 4000.

198
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,085
And you took from me,
my dearest good!

199
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,869
What an idiot...
You're an idiot!

200
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,372
All was well before the
arrival of the Fallon!

201
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,833
With your biased cards.
Why are you paid?

202
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:01,348
He called for new letters.
I could not prove it.

203
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,748
A loss game, it's a debt of honor.

204
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,379
Of all the other jewels,
my rings and everything...

205
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:10,582
It's my necklace that
took you to take...

206
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,132
It belonged to the mother, and grandmother...

207
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,167
You will break, the
heart of the father.

208
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,823
How can you?
Am sorry...

209
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,843
But I'm your brother.

210
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,447
Will you accuse me
instead of what?

211
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,043
Oh, I hate it!

212
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,728
From the moment he took it, the reins.
I'd rather that.

213
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,232
Equally.

214
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:33,145
Nothing must come
between us, Lawrence.

215
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,520
No discussion should separate.

216
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:38,103
Anything.
Never.

217
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,685
Good morning Mr. Polly.

218
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,186
Although the Hello Spuds.

219
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,693
To distribute.
Only one hand.

220
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,906
Money problem?
With me, always.

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,565
For this part of the
lighthouse you fired me. Hunm

222
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,394
I have enough to pay back.
Look at the end of the counter.

223
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,790
This guy who beat Caldwell
is a friend of yours?

224
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,248
O Fallon, yes.
Teach him to restrain himself.

225
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:12,655
Caldwell said he was wrong.

226
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,160
He wants to take your money.

227
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,959
There is talk of a
diamond necklace.

228
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:21,569
Yes.
You won!

229
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,268
Good to see you, Spud.
Thank you.

230
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,866
Collect your things, we have fled!

231
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:39,929
What?

232
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,636
Caldwell wants your skin.

233
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,666
You should not struggle
with this foundation.

234
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,676
What do we do?
Many.

235
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,631
These thieves know how
to play the knife!

236
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,839
So what?
A swimming lane?

237
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:54,278
Saw the captain, he will
jump, to third river yaw.

238
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,325
He does not want the corpse on board.
Come on!

239
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,648
They should be on board.

240
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:38,063
We should find them
before New Orleans.

241
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:41,150
Look at the door.
You machine room.

242
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,689
You top deck.

243
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,776
They are there!
Go get them!

244
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:31,305
To starboard.

245
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,030
We need you approaching the coast.

246
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,580
I'm not a big jumper.

247
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,580
This gold weighs a ton!
I'll take your bag.

248
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,605
Go, Polly!
Go.

249
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,647
Polly!

250
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:12,164
Polly!

251
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:32,569
I believe you drowned.

252
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:35,275
I had to get rid of
all the gold bags.

253
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:36,790
What?

254
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,037
I was caught in a mud tube.

255
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,775
I imagine they dig the water...

256
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:45,325
I've visited New Orleans,

257
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:46,500
But never walk!

258
00:20:54,188 --> 00:21:00,493
NEW ORLEANS

259
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,831
The colors, lines...
Beautiful!

260
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,830
Please sir.

261
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:11,776
What a city!

262
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,801
Even the names, the
streets are magical!

263
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:16,186
Carondolet, Royal St Charles...

264
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,369
Please.

265
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,731
Wait to see more:

266
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,838
Congo Square, Main Square,
Orleans Theater...

267
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,001
Here we are, we have
dinner tonight at Antoine.

268
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,874
Beautiful!
Satisfied, sir?

269
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,688
I'm excited!
Thank you.

270
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:31,688
I'll see you there at eight.

271
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:34,273
I'll try to make an
hour of fencing.

272
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,174
Do you ever want to
see Alley Exchange?

273
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,338
I dream from childhood,
and I started fencing.

274
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,353
My father boasted schools for:

275
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,870
The best after Paris.

276
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:45,456
"The street fencing
masters," in his words.

277
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,141
Mark.

278
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,950
Yes Prudence.
Here we are,

279
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,777
In the same mold as
Dureau and necklace.

280
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,697
These young Creoles
duel for nothing.

281
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,515
I'll stick with tile!

282
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,701
Do I have these... tat?

283
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:02,820
Certainly not!

284
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,853
Wash them and order several.

285
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,908
It's my work suit.

286
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,505
Affected!
Very nice shot, Mr. Fallon.

287
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,752
You're a formidable opponent!

288
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,238
Affected!

289
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,826
Mr. Dureau.
Gentlemen.

290
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:03,146
Good morning, dear Master.

291
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,130
Who is this young man?

292
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:08,324
Mr. Fallon from New York, I think.

293
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,538
Surprising for a northerner.
In fact.

294
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,719
Affected!

295
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,210
Always down the line!

296
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,656
Congratulations, sir.
Thank you.

297
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,764
Thanks for accepting me.

298
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,702
His low line inside
attack seems familiar.

299
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,054
Very unusual.

300
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:44,564
It's fun to play with the Master.

301
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,940
You just beat up
your best student.

302
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,524
Excuse me.

303
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,793
Good morning Mr. Dureau.
Good fight, Stephen.

304
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:51,990
Thank you sir.

305
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,160
Mr. Fallon, I'll introduce you, Mr.
Edmond Dureau.

306
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,720
Nice to meet you sir.
Congratulations, Mr. Fallon.

307
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,600
What courage to wait
long before Parry.

308
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:04,209
Thank you.
Mr. Dureau is a stern critic.

309
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,898
Your sense of distance
is extremely sharp.

310
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:09,819
Would you fight me when you rest?

311
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,793
With pleasure. Now?
Perfect.

312
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,644
No one seems to take advantage.

313
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,900
Let's start another day in
particular, and let mystery hover.

314
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,206
That suits me.

315
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:11,317
Thank you.

316
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,130
Aha, they talk a lot!

317
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,307
What a pleasure, to finally fight.

318
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,624
These fools have
Young cotton hands.

319
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,042
They speak of honor, but
they serve no purpose.

320
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,259
They wield their
swords like umbrellas.

321
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,486
Not Etienne, does not
seem to be like them.

322
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,641
This is a notable exception.

323
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:35,271
Who taught you?
My dad.

324
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:37,473
Fallon

325
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,772
There, I remember.
Did not he teach in Paris?

326
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,364
Yes.
Years ago.

327
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,681
I knew this attack
down the line inside.

328
00:25:47,707 --> 00:25:49,992
I went to your father's school.

329
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:51,211
How's it going?

330
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:53,212
He died recently in New York.

331
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,750
I'm sorry.
Apologies.

332
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,783
I also remember a one-year-old

333
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,434
Who was in his childhood, in
the Garden of Luxembourg.

334
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,534
Your father loved you.
Yes.

335
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,901
I'd love to have you at home.

336
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,523
Laurent Dureau, is he your son?

337
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,407
Yes.
Do you know him?

338
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:21,193
I met him and his
daughter on the boat.

339
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:24,546
Oh really? I do not think,
that they would appreciate it.

340
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:25,924
Why not?

341
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,271
River Je Joue.
Fool.

342
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,750
You are very good at spending
time in the game of tables.

343
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:34,750
How long?

344
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:36,825
Five days.
That explains everything.

345
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,458
Tomorrow afternoon, four o'clock?

346
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,120
Thank you.

347
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,509
Am I worthy of being
escorted by two masters?

348
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:00,469
What fishing for compliments!
Not even a little!

349
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:04,231
Do not let yourself be, George.
That only crushes St. Louis.

350
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,691
I did not buy anything in the North.
It's a Laselle!

351
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:09,911
Ignore him, Lia.
You look stunning.

352
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:12,606
Thank you sir.

353
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,851
You tell her since
she was 5 years old.

354
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:17,841
When are you going
to marry her, Lia?

355
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,785
He's funny, charming...

356
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:21,283
Good dancer.

357
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:23,019
Your father owns a bank.

358
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,033
And he's a good friend of mine.
That's it.

359
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,334
And I even tolerate this
idiot as a witness.

360
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,782
When will I marry you, Lia?

361
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,932
In years and years...
It's too long.

362
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,253
But I'm going to spend the afternoon with you,
if we're going to see the voodoo dancers.

363
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,604
We would be delighted.
Oh no...

364
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,640
Mr. Fallon.
Mr. Dureau is waiting.

365
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,824
You can wait here.
Thank you.

366
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,166
Welcome home, Mr. Fallon.
It's an honor, sir.

367
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:44,361
Lets sit.
Thank you.

368
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:49,456
Dad, we have dinner at Victor,
so let's go to the Congo...

369
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:52,357
Come in, my dear.

370
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:57,245
I do not wish to meet Mr.
Fallon again.

371
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:58,469
Angelique!

372
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,382
What do you expect of me, Father?

373
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:06,785
One expects to find such men in
bars, or in gambling houses.

374
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,403
But no one brings under one roof

375
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:11,704
To present to the hostess.

376
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:13,382
Angelica,

377
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,966
I choose carefully,
who enters my house.

378
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,913
And as long as they remain in
it, you owe them courtesy.

379
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,117
I apologize for my
daughter's rudeness.

380
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:34,813
It was a kind of embarrassment.

381
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,197
I have to give you that.

382
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:43,306
Your brother lost in
the game against me.

383
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,402
I saw this picture, and...

384
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,633
I wonder how much he means to you.

385
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,336
Yes indeed.

386
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:53,296
How much debt is he settled with?

387
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:55,319
$ 4100.

388
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,950
My bankers will solve it tomorrow.

389
00:29:57,976 --> 00:30:00,852
I do not want anything.
This is not your debt.

390
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:02,558
Without that, I will not accept it.

391
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:06,646
Sit down.

392
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:11,096
How about a glass of port?
Perfect.

393
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,900
My life...
catch me.

394
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,745
Unfortunately, my tumultuous youth

395
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:28,680
Acquired an aura of
legend in New Orleans.

396
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:32,321
My children are based on the mold
of their father's tradition.

397
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:37,121
They have grown up without a
mother since Lia's birth.

398
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:41,185
I've never been a big
fan of the sport.

399
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,937
When I first met, Miss Dureau,

400
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:47,584
I told him a necessary sweetness,
when nervous thoroughbred.

401
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:50,550
She did not do anything to say.

402
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,537
You expected to see her here, did not you?

403
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,072
Yes.

404
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:09,813
Dinner at Victor and Congo...

405
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:18,116
We must find two
very pretty ladies,

406
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:20,375
And in the city tonight.

407
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:54,234
If it is to lose too early,

408
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,111
I take it all on.

409
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:02,327
What pipelettes, so, that
do not interest you?

410
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,002
We have seen them a hundred times.

411
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:06,274
And you, what do you see?

412
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,905
I fear you will never understand.

413
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:17,948
Direction in Antoine, Moreau

414
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,507
And Michael, in that order.
And then?

415
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:27,597
Everyone is going to envy us.

416
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,850
Tell Dad.

417
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,145
I'm very glad you took the
car with me and George.

418
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:49,254
To accompany you?

419
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:51,617
Or to ask his hand again?

420
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:54,320
Both, my wise father.

421
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:56,307
He wants to advertise
for the ball tonight.

422
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,181
He only talks about it since
he presides over the bank.

423
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:03,473
He will solve, work hard, he
loves me, and paraphernalia...

424
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:05,159
And that does not interest you?

425
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:06,922
Is not it.

426
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:10,849
I have to keep telling you,
you're too young for that.

427
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,289
Your father always wanted to get married.

428
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:16,322
Is that you?

429
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,293
I think your choice
will be the right one.

430
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,871
When they are not too
young to decide.

431
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,246
Would not you be interested
in you Mark Fallon?

432
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:27,057
This man?
Certainly not!

433
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,980
Where did you come up with that idea?

434
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,942
Your name puts you
in a strange state.

435
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:35,095
Like a nail I would walk on.

436
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,601
Are you Mark?

437
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,658
I dine with him
when he's visiting.

438
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:44,244
It has become very popular.
I do not want to hear about it!

439
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:48,699
Why talk about it?
Because...

440
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,194
I want you to use
this for me tonight.

441
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,397
His mother always wore,

442
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,795
When I was bringing it
to the Governor's ball.

443
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:04,263
She was beautiful, Angelique.

444
00:37:06,978 --> 00:37:08,871
I want her to see you tonight.

445
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:18,435
Oh, I'm so ashamed...

446
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,725
Forgive me, Father.

447
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:24,400
I did not dare to tell him.
I knew how much it hurt you.

448
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:26,083
Lawrence and...

449
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,822
He does not deserve
you, with what you do.

450
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:30,126
I do not know why.

451
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:33,842
It seems to have it in my
blood, like a mad fever.

452
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,532
Yes, it's in our blood.

453
00:37:36,027 --> 00:37:38,018
I have nothing to
forgive you, baby.

454
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:43,587
You and Laurent are pale
copies of your father.

455
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:44,908
Come on.

456
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:46,429
What would the governor be?

457
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:49,366
If I escorted two
eyes full of tears?

458
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:02,466
Edmond!
Mrs. Lisanne.

459
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:07,323
Lia, I'd like to announce
our engagement tonight.

460
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,254
I beg, not tonight.

461
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,304
Forgive me.

462
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,507
Angelique!

463
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:22,346
Ah...!
Welcome, dear.

464
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,048
The ball can begin.

465
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:25,226
Your Honor.

466
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,844
Edmund, my friend.
Paul.

467
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,945
George.
Your Honor.

468
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,453
Angelica, I present my very
good friend Mr. Fallon.

469
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,640
Miss Dureau.

470
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:36,421
Good evening.

471
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,983
I had the pleasure.

472
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:39,717
Do you know?
Perfect.

473
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:43,433
How's Mark?
Good and you, sir?

474
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,665
Do you know Mr. Elwood?
George, Mr. Fallon.

475
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:48,971
Mr. Elwood.

476
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:52,726
It's my pleasure, sir.

477
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,945
How are you doing!
We apologize.

478
00:38:56,987 --> 00:39:01,402
Of course. It would be a crime
to miss a dance with Angelique.

479
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,454
His Excellency is very good.

480
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,320
Can I have this dance?

481
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:17,237
It's my turn.
I first, you come later.

482
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:20,277
Where is Lawrence?
He clings to champagne.

483
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,378
I offered a lunch on Sunday.
Will you join us?

484
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:20,640
With pleasure.

485
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:21,780
Mark!

486
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:24,136
Angelique Joint our Sunday lunch.

487
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:25,176
you will be?

488
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:27,802
I'd love to, but I'll
take the river tomorrow.

489
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,466
Business before pleasure.

490
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:32,367
Not tonight.
Miss Dureau,

491
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,515
Can I have this dance?

492
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:36,203
Good...

493
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,794
Do not worry, I said
you're a great dancer.

494
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:58,292
Thank you.

495
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,288
Thank you instead of the Governor.

496
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:01,903
I will.

497
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,614
I have been delighted
if you refuse.

498
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:08,659
I doubt it.
That's why I waited.

499
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:16,837
This necklace will you,
just like your mother.

500
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,914
I'm amazed you returned
to your father.

501
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,544
You could not sell it?

502
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,378
Is that what you really think?

503
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,102
Yes.

504
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:34,105
You're right.
He paid me.

505
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:39,582
Can I ask you a question
before you leave abruptly?

506
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,756
Yes. Considering what I think

507
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,382
Why do you humiliate me?

508
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:45,925
Out of courtesy.

509
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:47,538
A man invites a woman,

510
00:41:47,564 --> 00:41:50,177
To humiliate you must
be willing to risk.

511
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:52,741
I do not understand.

512
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,200
We are in love with each other.

513
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,529
It's forever.

514
00:41:57,986 --> 00:42:00,625
We know from the first moment, in St.
Louis.

515
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,764
But you're not ready for marriage.

516
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,858
And I'll do it, when
you come to me.

517
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,129
You are totally self-centered.

518
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:11,054
Yeah, you say you like
this, I can start.

519
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:14,834
But that's how a woman
can be happy with a man.

520
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:36,900
Lia!

521
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:43,581
What is going on?
You try to kill him?

522
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,264
Or send me to the hospital?

523
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,043
Do you exercise.
You'll sleep better.

524
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,375
I have no problem sleeping.

525
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,176
Ah...!
I love this place!

526
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:56,229
The river is beautiful seen from here.

527
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,726
The boats look like little toys,

528
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:01,394
With their white ropes.

529
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:04,209
These boats make you
very sentimental.

530
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,590
Or are they the passengers?

531
00:43:07,372 --> 00:43:08,841
Do not talk silly.

532
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,909
I enjoy just the view.

533
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:12,831
You pay enough attention.

534
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:15,184
George brought it there yesterday.

535
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,246
Why not?
These are the father earth.

536
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:19,190
One day, I'm going to build a house.

537
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:21,132
You?

538
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:25,262
If you arrive, Lia?
Anything!

539
00:43:43,178 --> 00:43:45,261
Do you count cotton won?

540
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:48,553
No, I think the money, that
you put me to the bank,

541
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,327
At the other end of the
country into foreign hands.

542
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:52,581
I do not normally.

543
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:55,958
Do you know what you're
going to do with it? What?

544
00:43:55,984 --> 00:43:58,559
It will open a restaurant
with games room,

545
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,249
Better than New Orleans:

546
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:03,061
Rich, exclusive, crystal, silver.

547
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:06,039
All to please the
women who will play.

548
00:44:06,065 --> 00:44:08,874
Women playing?
Where did you come up with that idea?

549
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,026
Where do they go when
their husbands play?

550
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:13,620
Tea, sewing groups, stand alone.

551
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,195
They're bored, Polly.

552
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:17,859
They want to have fun
like their husbands.

553
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:19,861
We'll handle it.
Do not.

554
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:22,829
Try what you want but
me stay in the river.

555
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,142
As you wish, but I'll bet you

556
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:28,127
You come running when, I'll
open those beacon tables.

557
00:44:28,153 --> 00:44:30,064
I prefer them on boats.

558
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:35,435
Since when are you
in the river, Polly?

559
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:37,264
Almost thirty years.

560
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,610
Is not life very lonely?

561
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:42,618
Well, yes...
When I was young,

562
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:45,107
I was hoping that all,

563
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:47,255
The beautiful girls board boats,

564
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,951
Instead of hiding in the houses.

565
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:54,968
I spent nights watching the
light from their windows.

566
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,927
Think about it.

567
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,704
Especially the lights
on the floors.

568
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:06,735
He begins to dream, on
nights like this...

569
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,798
This is not good.
Do not.

570
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:12,025
I back.
Polly.

571
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:14,904
Good old cards part 5?

572
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:17,625
Yes, you convinced me.

573
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:22,163
But sometimes it really
itches, to go rub me,

574
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:23,876
With these thugs!
Hunm...

575
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:35,864
No conference tomorrow morning.

576
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,420
We only happen 13.30
to New Orleans.

577
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:40,581
That leaves more time for poker.

578
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,873
Can I send, Mr. Fallon?

579
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:45,378
I'm Julian Conant.
Satisfied.

580
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:48,509
I was introduced to a
fair game for his tables.

581
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,032
Yes it's true.

582
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:56,673
I will be able to participate,
if you and the gentlemen accept.

583
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,809
With pleasure.
Welcome drnhor!

584
00:45:58,835 --> 00:46:01,341
Parts 6 are much better.
Thank you very much.

585
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:07,954
Ah, you do not pretend in the game!

586
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,774
200.

587
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:19,839
Pay, and I raise 300.
Without me.

588
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,182
You're very unlucky tonight.

589
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,291
Maybe we should stop to enjoy it.

590
00:46:30,317 --> 00:46:32,401
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Thank you.

591
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:35,194
But he's better already.
500 more.

592
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,662
Pay.
Too tall for me.

593
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:42,527
Pay.
Pass.

594
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:44,006
A letter.

595
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:46,081
I keep mine.

596
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:50,349
Equally.
Check.

597
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:59,270
1,000.
Hunm...

598
00:47:08,209 --> 00:47:10,447
Paid out.
I lie.

599
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:18,141
Game of Kings.
Type of Aces

600
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,822
Can I ask you a question, Mr.
Fallon?

601
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,289
Of course.

602
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:26,648
You knew your set was on my hand.

603
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:29,661
I was sure.
As?

604
00:47:31,662 --> 00:47:34,889
I noticed that when you
bluff, and only then,

605
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:38,072
You place your thumb on
the edge of the cards.

606
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:53,521
Gentlemen.

607
00:48:18,345 --> 00:48:19,767
Mr. Conant...

608
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:23,398
Why did he do it?
He lost all his money.

609
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:26,676
Your sister is on board.
It is my responsibility to avoid...

610
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:27,874
I would like to accompany you.

611
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:30,424
Take care of him.

612
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:40,054
Who's there?

613
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,206
Captain Evers, Madame.
Aha...!

614
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:43,355
In between.

615
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:48,768
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening.

616
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,580
I'm afraid we have bad news.

617
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:52,830
His brother...

618
00:48:52,856 --> 00:48:54,812
Julian?
What is going on?

619
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:56,670
He committed suicide.

620
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,561
Where is he?
It's useless.

621
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:00,654
I have to see.

622
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,524
Best to stay here.
You can do anything.

623
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:06,401
No...

624
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:11,984
This one...
It's impossible.

625
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,131
He would never do that.
There is no reason...

626
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:19,554
You can...
Contact your parents?

627
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,402
Or someone you know?

628
00:49:22,587 --> 00:49:24,383
We do not have parents.

629
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:27,563
I do not believe...

630
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,365
Julian never...

631
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,614
He was taking money,
to your company.

632
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,049
Someone tried to steal it!

633
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:42,279
Aha...
Should be it.

634
00:49:43,344 --> 00:49:45,096
He was more careful than that.

635
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:48,680
He left his money safe
with the captain.

636
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:53,062
I am a friend of Captain, Ms.
Conant.

637
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,489
Mark Fallon.
I am at your service.

638
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,436
If I can help you, or
here in New Orleans.

639
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:00,281
I'll be grateful.

640
00:50:00,923 --> 00:50:02,759
I do not know anyone there.

641
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,555
Please sign here, please.

642
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,100
Name and your brother's name.

643
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:24,419
I'm sorry to arrest you
under these circumstances.

644
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:27,615
I could have come to the
hotel, but the bank had...

645
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,880
But make sure the details
with your company.

646
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:30,967
I get it.

647
00:50:35,384 --> 00:50:36,643
Can you tell?

648
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:40,060
Mr. Elwood, please
check the contracts,

649
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:41,891
And make the deposit.
Right.

650
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:49,492
George.
Good morning, Lawrence.

651
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:51,425
I'm done, and I'm yours.

652
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,708
And this girl with Fallon?
Ms. Conant.

653
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,531
Ann Conant.
It's beautiful.

654
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:57,840
Yes indeed.
Introduce it to me.

655
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:00,944
This is not the time, she
just lost her brother.

656
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,326
He was buried this morning.
Sorry to hear.

657
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:06,500
I've never seen such
a beautiful woman.

658
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:10,278
Please, George.
I have to meet her.

659
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:12,935
It's ok.

660
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:16,910
Everything is in order.

661
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:19,588
Thanks again.

662
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,696
My condolences.

663
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,419
Mr. Fallon.
Bye.

664
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:24,450
Ms. Conant.

665
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:26,780
This is my friend Laurent Dureau.

666
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,667
Very much like Ms. Conant.

667
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,248
Mr. Fallon.
Mr. Dureau.

668
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:33,678
Ms. Conant apologize, she
came back to the hotel.

669
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:35,634
I get it.
My condolences.

670
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,649
If I can do anything,
I'd be delighted.

671
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,872
Thank you.

672
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:50,789
Polly?

673
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,611
Hello, how are you? Good morning, Ms.
Conant.

674
00:51:57,102 --> 00:52:00,253
I spoke with the manager, you
will get a room in an hour.

675
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:01,806
We...

676
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,355
We thought you would like
the quiet lunch here.

677
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,726
Thank you.

678
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:11,197
Hunm... You've been
very, wonderful to me.

679
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:13,192
You help me more, than you know.

680
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:17,516
This is not helping.
We thank you.

681
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:18,839
Also...

682
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:22,220
Cam Polly navigate, for
the next North week.

683
00:52:22,246 --> 00:52:24,635
If you want to enjoy it go...

684
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:25,882
Good...

685
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:29,636
I have no reason to go
back to Springfield now.

686
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,697
We live there, Julian's work.

687
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,078
I'd rather live here.

688
00:52:35,142 --> 00:52:37,121
I'm going to find an apartment.

689
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:39,847
It's a beautiful city.
You will be happy.

690
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:42,259
You will know that very
interesting people.

691
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:43,716
So?

692
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,495
Yes.
Very well.

693
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:49,525
Let's start, look tomorrow.

694
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:53,218
Mr. Polly, and have
you gone a long time?

695
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:56,014
No, we return in a heartbeat.

696
00:52:56,575 --> 00:52:58,055
You're a very pretty girl, Ann.

697
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:00,659
As soon as you see in public
you will be so engrossed

698
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:02,164
You forget soon.

699
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,138
This will never happen.

700
00:53:11,303 --> 00:53:12,385
For Ms. Conant.

701
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:14,909
Mr. Polly said she would be here.
Yes.

702
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:17,082
Thank you sir.

703
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:21,869
Ah...!
They are beautiful!

704
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:23,764
Aha...

705
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:30,955
Laurent Dureau?

706
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,331
The man on the bench.

707
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,069
It's a nice touch.

708
00:53:42,007 --> 00:53:44,021
You are already noticed in public.

709
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:58,524
Distribute below!
Lie!

710
00:54:01,344 --> 00:54:04,063
Would you kill a man
before you start?

711
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:07,007
Leave that part!

712
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,977
Good...

713
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:13,955
You were right.

714
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,809
Honest play is busier than diddle!

715
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,751
Camellias, to Mademoiselle.

716
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,534
Greetings from Mr. Dureau.
Thank you.

717
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,324
Ah...!
They are excellent!

718
00:54:32,926 --> 00:54:35,486
Everyone is so good to me.

719
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:36,989
My apartment looks like a garden.

720
00:54:37,015 --> 00:54:38,629
I went through all this!

721
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:40,134
I looked at his windows.

722
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:42,874
Hoping you'd like to go outside.

723
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:48,702
Who is this beauty with Laurent?
We do not know.

724
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:50,260
We will see.

725
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,310
Did you see Lawrence jealous?

726
00:54:52,504 --> 00:54:55,255
Do not.
I hope to introduce myself.

727
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:56,917
He's crazy about her.

728
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:59,107
No competition then?

729
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:00,882
No competition.

730
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:04,357
Like the opera?

731
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,664
I had never attended.
Really?

732
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:09,604
We then spend a
beautiful Sunday night.

733
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,831
Julia sings Calve from
the Orleans Theater.

734
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:13,225
Oho, I'm so sorry.

735
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,882
I'd love to hear
it, but I can not.

736
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,598
Mrs. Fallon and Polly arrive.
I found the boat.

737
00:55:19,624 --> 00:55:22,241
Please.
I really counted.

738
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:23,959
Maybe another time.

739
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:25,483
Many other times.

740
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:30,277
What a day!

741
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,471
I spent my life walking fine.

742
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,528
You were right.
About what?

743
00:55:35,554 --> 00:55:37,745
I find happiness in New Orleans.

744
00:55:39,328 --> 00:55:41,314
I love every song.

745
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:44,497
The old houses,
picturesque fireplaces...

746
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:47,522
The wrought iron decorations
on the balconies.

747
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:49,878
We want to live, anywhere

748
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:53,330
And know all those who
walked these ancient stones.

749
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,588
Are you a historian or hostess?

750
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:59,140
Instead of a hostess.

751
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:24,043
Lawrence's sister.
Angélique Dureau.

752
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:26,797
Oh, she's as beautiful
as your name.

753
00:56:26,823 --> 00:56:28,347
I'd love to meet her.

754
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:32,664
The date?
Yes, and your father.

755
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,000
Laurent invited me to
your house this week.

756
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:39,886
Do you mind?

757
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:42,724
You will find a tall gentleman.

758
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:55,717
What is Mark?
Nervous?

759
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,823
I am worried.
For Ann.

760
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,592
What does she feel for you?

761
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:06,630
She had her share of suffering.

762
00:57:07,945 --> 00:57:10,622
Well this is a game
where you can not win.

763
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:13,457
We were to get lost in much
seeing the window lights.

764
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:17,373
And if we take a look...
He is also lost.

765
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:38,619
Laurent?

766
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,846
We do not have an appointment...
I had to see it!

767
00:57:42,968 --> 00:57:45,383
I can not stand getting
away from you!

768
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:48,487
These formalities, my family...
What are the formalities?

769
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:49,652
You...

770
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:52,252
It's just worldliness.
Do not.

771
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:54,436
I want to marry you.

772
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,760
I love you, Ann.
I could not wait.

773
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,580
Oh, but...
You are mistaken, certainly.

774
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:02,983
Look...

775
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:05,804
We know so little.

776
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:08,495
Time means nothing.

777
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,386
You became my vision
when I saw you.

778
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,939
I've never been in love before.

779
00:58:15,312 --> 00:58:17,607
I never imagined
anything so perfect.

780
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,003
However, such torture...

781
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,563
I offer my last devotion, Ann.

782
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:25,492
You Marry and me?
Today? Now?

783
00:58:30,164 --> 00:58:31,974
I'm sorry, Lawrence.

784
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,653
You've been wonderful to me... No!

785
00:58:34,732 --> 00:58:37,134
Do not refuse me, not again!

786
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,310
I asked him very early.

787
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:42,114
I await your response,
take your time.

788
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,525
No, I have to answer now.

789
00:58:44,877 --> 00:58:46,706
Do not feed this hope.

790
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:48,918
I can never love you.

791
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,480
Are you in love with someone else?

792
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,275
Yes I am!

793
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,010
Without Fallon?
Yes.

794
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:59,418
Oh, you ruin your
love with this man.

795
00:58:59,444 --> 00:59:01,476
He does not deserve your look!

796
00:59:01,502 --> 00:59:03,621
Please.
He confuses you.

797
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:05,419
It confuses everyone.

798
00:59:05,785 --> 00:59:07,914
Did you say he loves my sister?

799
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:11,931
Angelique?

800
00:59:11,957 --> 00:59:14,260
He has loved since his arrival.

801
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:17,546
How to love such a person?

802
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,885
I think love does not
necessarily wait to return.

803
00:59:58,273 --> 01:00:01,766
Come and have dinner with us.
I did not want.

804
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:09,980
What is he?
I do not know, but he drinks...

805
01:00:10,718 --> 01:00:13,419
I'll get your car.
We should bring him back.

806
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,120
Good evening, Mr. Fallon.

807
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,969
How many women do
you need, Fallon?

808
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:37,815
Is not my sister enough?

809
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:40,019
Mr. Dureau...
Stay out of it!

810
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:43,116
You're lying to Ann about me.

811
01:00:43,183 --> 01:00:44,480
Of separating us.

812
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,959
You offer him an
apartment to persuade!

813
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:49,965
Go home sober yourself
before saying too much!

814
01:00:52,877 --> 01:00:55,119
See you in duel Oaks!

815
01:00:55,145 --> 01:00:57,230
If you can leave your women.

816
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:58,598
When you please.

817
01:00:58,624 --> 01:01:00,380
Our witnesses will solve this.

818
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:01,595
Come on!

819
01:01:05,654 --> 01:01:08,559
Mr. Fallon...
You are crazy?

820
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,595
He will kill you in a duel.
Stephen said...

821
01:01:10,621 --> 01:01:13,257
I'm stronger than you.
Yes but...

822
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,632
It's all my fault.
Let me talk to him.

823
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,916
It has nothing to
do with you, Ann.

824
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:23,227
It's been dragging for a long time.

825
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:32,480
No need for that, Mark.
You'll get your hands down.

826
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:35,958
The will that bequeathed me half
of its possessions, let's see...

827
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,104
Do you think something
bad could happen?

828
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:42,569
You will be my witness, Polly.

829
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:45,236
Take your friend Bozener
game as the second.

830
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:48,246
You need to be able to
organize paris in it.

831
01:01:53,224 --> 01:01:54,969
Mr. Fallon?
Enter.

832
01:02:01,068 --> 01:02:03,765
I'm Pierre Lagnier.
Here André Briant.

833
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:06,095
We came from Mr. Laurent Dureau.

834
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,442
Ms. Conant, Mr. Polly.

835
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,436
Speak freely.

836
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:14,169
We'd like to talk to
your witnesses...

837
01:02:14,195 --> 01:02:16,696
Avoid these formalities.
Tomorrow morning, 6:00?

838
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,012
It's all right.

839
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:21,677
As offended, you have
the choice of weapons.

840
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:22,872
Weapons.

841
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,364
Thank you sir.

842
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:35,496
Weapons?
Mark, are you crazy?

843
01:02:38,661 --> 01:02:39,889
Do not worry about it.

844
01:02:56,612 --> 01:02:57,690
In between.

845
01:03:13,484 --> 01:03:17,568
Are you going to kill Lawrence?
Maybe he'll kill me.

846
01:03:18,742 --> 01:03:21,553
Did you come to stop me?
Do not.

847
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:29,432
Are you as good a
weapon as the sword?

848
01:03:30,592 --> 01:03:31,656
Not really.

849
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:37,699
Did you come to see me because
I could be dead tomorrow?

850
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:41,595
I came because someone in the family

851
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:44,132
Thank you for not playing
to your advantage.

852
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:46,011
But you ignore this imbalance

853
01:03:46,037 --> 01:03:47,516
Before I talk to you.

854
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,755
Angelique!

855
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,410
Angelique!

856
01:03:59,522 --> 01:04:03,036
Will you admit that you
hide behind your brother?

857
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:05,700
You admire because you
are afraid to live.

858
01:04:05,726 --> 01:04:06,943
And the men!

859
01:04:07,031 --> 01:04:09,355
Why did your mother die
when you were born?

860
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:11,335
You're so alive!

861
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:14,140
You thirst for life!
Leave me!

862
01:04:15,073 --> 01:04:16,885
I hope he goes to kill you!

863
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,364
In position, gentlemen.

864
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:11,668
You will have ten steps.

865
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:13,037
Ahead:...

866
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:16,771
One two three four five six...

867
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:19,617
seven eight nine ten.

868
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:22,430
I'll count to three.

869
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,483
At three,

870
01:05:24,509 --> 01:05:26,459
You will come back, and you will call.

871
01:05:27,146 --> 01:05:28,492
Are you ready?

872
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,941
A.
Two.

873
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:47,980
You can shoot, Mr. Fallon.

874
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:42,821
Sometimes, sir.

875
01:06:57,865 --> 01:06:59,129
I asked Lawrence.

876
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:02,062
He told me everything.
I have the right to listen.

877
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:03,333
Laurent

878
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,677
Gather your things and
leave, as soon as possible.

879
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:10,310
Father...
You can not...

880
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,819
Lawrence!

881
01:07:17,602 --> 01:07:19,951
At the time, he
needs more for you.

882
01:07:20,114 --> 01:07:23,787
Father, you can not.
The whole city will be against him.

883
01:07:23,813 --> 01:07:27,558
You will accept that George Elwood
is the one to help you and not you,

884
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:30,992
Your own family?
I have nothing to add.

885
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,499
If he leaves...
I leave with your father.

886
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:41,596
This house is very empty
without you, Angelique.

887
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:01,994
His Excellency the Governor Paul O.
Monet

888
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,144
Invites you to the wedding of
Mademoiselle Angélique Dureau

889
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:08,937
With Mr. George Elwood

890
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:12,539
Wednesday, December
15, 1844 at 3:30 p.m.

891
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:28,999
I'll see you in the car.

892
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:36,849
What did he read?

893
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,566
Another month and it will be
the end of your social life.

894
01:08:40,592 --> 01:08:43,888
I still refused nights
that uninvited Lawrence.

895
01:08:44,071 --> 01:08:45,208
Perfect.

896
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:47,897
Continue. They are razor
blades, after all.

897
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:50,725
Keep your head up.
Always high.

898
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:54,064
I like to see you through
restaurants with Laurent and me.

899
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,021
You walk like a queen,
ignoring your contempt.

900
01:08:58,429 --> 01:08:59,703
You're fabulous.

901
01:09:01,074 --> 01:09:03,306
And your mother was fabulous too.

902
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,627
The wedding invitations are here.
Perfect!

903
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:13,685
"Miss Marriage...
Angélique Dureau with... "

904
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,616
What a beautiful name!

905
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:20,320
She did not marry this guy
because he is used to it?

906
01:09:20,492 --> 01:09:21,906
To live with him?

907
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:25,018
Because he was always
dedicated to it.

908
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,806
The sweetest person she's ever met.
Hunm, hunm...

909
01:09:29,322 --> 01:09:31,771
And a little love, if
he hides in there?

910
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,669
We'll find him.
I love you.

911
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:58,646
Monaieurd Edmond Dureaud

912
01:10:17,749 --> 01:10:19,067
Angelique!

913
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:26,738
I could not stay out, and
you send the invitation.

914
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:28,345
I'm happy.

915
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:31,339
I could not go up, the
sidewalk without you.

916
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:34,883
Are you going to give me your arm?
Of course?

917
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,520
Are you sure, Lia?
Do you want?

918
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:42,215
Not to make a mistake.

919
01:10:43,093 --> 01:10:45,666
Of course!
What question...

920
01:10:45,692 --> 01:10:48,718
We grew up with the idea
of getting married.

921
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,007
Our two families.

922
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:53,150
It's obvious to all New Orleans.

923
01:10:53,294 --> 01:10:56,416
This is all true...
But you love?

924
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,130
Yes.

925
01:11:09,451 --> 01:11:12,909
I also received it.
You like Mark.

926
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:18,608
Yes.
Stop everything.

927
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:19,959
Go get it.

928
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:23,874
Do you really think that
she knows very well

929
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,191
To find love in any wedding?

930
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,754
Do not.
I just hoped.

931
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:27,291
My dear brothers,

932
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:31,114
We are here before God today

933
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,368
And before all these people,

934
01:12:33,394 --> 01:12:37,354
To join this man and this
woman in the sacred marriage.

935
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,959
These two people
have to be united,

936
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,725
In these sacred bonds.

937
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,578
If anyone here has a
legitimate reason

938
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:48,673
To oppose this loyal union,

939
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:50,654
He speaks now,

940
01:12:50,804 --> 01:12:55,044
Or shut up without ever
speaking again, forever

941
01:12:57,525 --> 01:13:00,167
I ask and I beg you so much

942
01:13:00,524 --> 01:13:03,769
Knowing that you will have to
answer on the day of judgment

943
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:07,529
When hearts secrets
will be revealed...

944
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:12,660
Living together in this life
and in the world to come,

945
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:15,187
Where your life will be eternal.

946
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,017
Amen.

947
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,126
Congratulations, George.

948
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,514
Congratulations.
Thank you.

949
01:13:46,346 --> 01:13:47,775
It is wonderful.

950
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:50,795
Long and happy life!
Honor the groom!

951
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:56,123
Expand this one meter arch.

952
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:59,714
The game room is visible
from the entire restaurant.

953
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,559
If a big gain causes excitement,
all customers should know!

954
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,683
Eat less, play more.
I'll make a double bow.

955
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:08,092
Well, perfect.

956
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:09,900
I am often in the river.

957
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:12,761
Ms. Conant will deal
with interior design.

958
01:14:12,787 --> 01:14:14,988
Materials, furniture, everything!

959
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:16,400
It will be a pleasure.

960
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:18,149
You will have a staff
at your service.

961
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:21,482
Still not interested, Polly?
It is not for me.

962
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:23,934
I invested, but you
will not make me use

963
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,233
These tails-coats in Day length!

964
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:28,445
Cow tails that hunt flies!

965
01:14:28,734 --> 01:14:30,882
I think for you.

966
01:14:30,908 --> 01:14:33,347
You could throw the
beacon to your desk.

967
01:14:33,373 --> 01:14:35,264
Without ever losing a penny.

968
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:38,339
Where will be located lighthouse?

969
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:40,531
I will show you.
Maybe you'll get better.

970
01:14:40,557 --> 01:14:42,358
Hunm, hunm...
It's a conspiracy!

971
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:44,008
Come on.

972
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:49,991
A double bow is perfect!

973
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,225
I wish him to stay with us.

974
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:55,853
Equally.

975
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:58,849
Things are getting closer, and
I have not earned enough.

976
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,706
To protect against losses.

977
01:15:00,925 --> 01:15:04,703
Maybe convince Polly.
This table lighthouse likes.

978
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:09,634
Lia!
Lia!

979
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,847
She never talks about her brother.

980
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:14,810
Anyone know where Lawrence is?

981
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:16,250
Do not.
Anything.

982
01:15:16,276 --> 01:15:18,115
Lia!
Hurry up!

983
01:15:18,141 --> 01:15:19,513
A few minutes!

984
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:21,194
We're late!

985
01:15:21,635 --> 01:15:24,536
It must always be late, to
make a triumphal entry!

986
01:15:24,669 --> 01:15:27,876
Women will hate us in
our Parisian dresses!

987
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:29,373
Where are you, Lia?

988
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:31,396
As well?
I am here.

989
01:15:32,019 --> 01:15:34,476
Do not.
Where are you?

990
01:15:34,861 --> 01:15:38,350
When I hold you in my arms,
you seem to be miles away.

991
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,103
It's like waving a passing shadow.

992
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:45,094
No substance, no heat.

993
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:48,906
George!
How can you say that?

994
01:15:50,052 --> 01:15:52,483
Take me in your arms.
I am here.

995
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:54,610
We are never there.
Never alone.

996
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:57,330
For our moon, you run away.

997
01:15:57,455 --> 01:15:58,814
All these people...

998
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,145
I love you Lia, but you escape me.

999
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:04,090
What is going on?

1000
01:16:05,859 --> 01:16:08,361
I really do not
see, what you mean.

1001
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,302
I was scared when
Lawrence disappeared.

1002
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:13,171
But not anymore.

1003
01:16:14,307 --> 01:16:16,202
I love you, George.

1004
01:16:16,565 --> 01:16:19,277
I try to make you happy and proud.

1005
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:22,580
Tell me I can at least a little.

1006
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:26,026
Honey, I do not know
why I say this...

1007
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:31,093
I will also require...
I want to be by your side.

1008
01:16:31,452 --> 01:16:33,890
George!
Lia!

1009
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,192
Come on!

1010
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:56,734
Good! Fallon is not
cards, how lucky!

1011
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,622
Like a beautiful lady!

1012
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:05,119
It's a lie, Carnes!
Ms. Conant is a lady

1013
01:17:05,145 --> 01:17:07,630
And Mark Fallon
incorporates, a gentleman.

1014
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:09,353
Remove this slander!

1015
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:10,782
<i>You are in the if Dureau.</i>

1016
01:17:10,808 --> 01:17:13,626
He did not rent his apartment
for Platonic reasons.

1017
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:15,884
He lets decorate, his casino.

1018
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:17,349
I do not drink anything!

1019
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,671
I will choose my witnesses
this afternoon.

1020
01:17:19,697 --> 01:17:20,721
With pleasure!

1021
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,209
I would have liked
to stay till later.

1022
01:17:34,235 --> 01:17:36,565
Yes.
Beautiful day.

1023
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:38,447
Do not Fallon!

1024
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:41,171
What does he call your business?

1025
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:42,605
"Louisiana"

1026
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,517
He's going to travel
there to see this.

1027
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:06,806
Mark Warning!

1028
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:37,199
Dureau!

1029
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:48,394
Who is it?

1030
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:50,519
Why did he do it?
Do you know him?

1031
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:53,226
I had never seen it.
I do not even know who it is!

1032
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:58,332
Good luck for "Louisiana"!
See you at the opening!

1033
01:18:58,617 --> 01:18:59,975
Goodbye, Mark.

1034
01:19:02,378 --> 01:19:04,287
Good morning, Polly.
I missed you.

1035
01:19:04,313 --> 01:19:06,483
I...
What is it?

1036
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:09,806
I have bad news, Mark.
What?

1037
01:19:09,832 --> 01:19:13,209
Mr. Dureau has heard
you and Ann bad.

1038
01:19:13,235 --> 01:19:15,975
And he is not the
swordsman he was.

1039
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,447
It is well kneaded.

1040
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:31,073
Mark.
Come, sit down.

1041
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,042
Stay with me, Angelica.

1042
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:40,202
Thank you for defending Ms. Conant.

1043
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:41,905
But you would have waited, for me.

1044
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:45,523
I never left insulting a woman.

1045
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:49,081
Maybe that's why I
lived a double life.

1046
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:50,831
Come back fast.

1047
01:19:51,257 --> 01:19:54,106
You promised to be at the
opening of "Louisiana."

1048
01:19:54,132 --> 01:19:56,565
No...
I will not be there, Mark.

1049
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,910
No regrets.

1050
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,687
I lived a long life.
And now...

1051
01:20:01,915 --> 01:20:04,049
I lost my duelist qualities.

1052
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:06,541
It seems that this time...

1053
01:20:06,705 --> 01:20:08,424
Where people lived,
by the sword...

1054
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:09,936
Disappears with me.

1055
01:20:14,672 --> 01:20:15,943
You...

1056
01:20:16,885 --> 01:20:20,779
You said one day that no
shadow will separate us. Yes.

1057
01:20:21,978 --> 01:20:24,953
I have never been
more difficult...

1058
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:28,800
Since you say...

1059
01:20:30,395 --> 01:20:31,533
Laurent?

1060
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:37,319
He boarded Memphis.
With a knife.

1061
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:40,672
I did not recognize it at first.
He was flustered.

1062
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:42,331
Everything happened, very quickly.

1063
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:46,271
I was not armed.
I tried to contain it.

1064
01:20:46,646 --> 01:20:49,762
We Fight.
He fell...

1065
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:52,870
On your knife.

1066
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:56,636
No one could do anything.

1067
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:05,420
Ahai, aha. Aha
Thank you for telling me.

1068
01:21:06,326 --> 01:21:08,018
I can not blame you,

1069
01:21:08,044 --> 01:21:09,880
anyway.
Aha...

1070
01:21:10,857 --> 01:21:12,833
Promise me one thing.

1071
01:21:13,097 --> 01:21:14,723
Anything.
Aha...

1072
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:16,445
Protect Angelique.

1073
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,074
Ever.
Aha...

1074
01:21:21,017 --> 01:21:22,682
You have my word.

1075
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,813
Aha, aha, there...

1076
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:29,403
Aha...

1077
01:22:03,903 --> 01:22:05,173
Angelique...

1078
01:22:07,379 --> 01:22:09,735
I thought one day,
we had our chances.

1079
01:22:10,977 --> 01:22:14,023
But it seems I've destroyed
everything I loved.

1080
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,333
Maybe you knew all along.

1081
01:22:19,177 --> 01:22:20,523
I immersed myself.

1082
01:22:44,438 --> 01:22:46,626
It's Affected There!

1083
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,017
Mark!
Sanford!

1084
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:52,860
Your bass inside the
line is always perfect!

1085
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:55,224
Thanks for the fight, Master.
With pleasure.

1086
01:22:55,822 --> 01:22:56,880
Thank you.

1087
01:22:57,398 --> 01:22:59,011
What is going on?

1088
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:01,393
Do you keep your money
well at Elwood Bank?

1089
01:23:01,424 --> 01:23:04,973
Yes. Remove it tomorrow.
That's what we do.

1090
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,477
Because? Elwood neglects his bank.

1091
01:23:07,503 --> 01:23:09,271
It's Jette's agent
through the windows.

1092
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:12,050
Furniture of Paris.
And the diamonds Angelique!

1093
01:23:12,076 --> 01:23:14,911
You have nothing to do.
He has the right to be rich!

1094
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:17,791
Not so rich
I'm sure of one thing:

1095
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:20,854
Move away from this bank
and you get to that rumor!

1096
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,124
We are right!

1097
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,393
We received a confidential report.

1098
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:42,657
Angelica has to transfer all
her assets this morning.

1099
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:44,827
His father was always
at Southern Federal.

1100
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,699
This is normal.
The economy for the husband bank.

1101
01:23:48,725 --> 01:23:51,054
The opposite would be to
create family discord.

1102
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,296
Elmer!

1103
01:23:53,314 --> 01:23:56,495
Four large drinks for three
nervous financially.

1104
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:58,601
Let me tell you:

1105
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:01,125
Not only will I leave,
my money there,

1106
01:24:01,151 --> 01:24:04,356
But tomorrow I'll see
you remove yours.

1107
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:06,548
All right, Mark.
You will regret it.

1108
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:16,308
Sorry sir.

1109
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,705
They dine, I can not bother them.

1110
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:21,574
Where are you, sir?
Sir, do not...

1111
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,742
Did not you get my message?

1112
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,934
I'm sorry, sir.

1113
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:28,495
It's nothing, Benjamin.
Yes sir.

1114
01:24:32,071 --> 01:24:34,718
It's very important,
for me, allow me.

1115
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,138
John Sanford, Hewitt
and Alden Keith

1116
01:24:37,164 --> 01:24:40,437
Planned to empty their
bills tomorrow morning.

1117
01:24:40,607 --> 01:24:42,490
Your bank will it collect itself?

1118
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:46,026
My bank is good.
Yours is so empty too!

1119
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:49,230
The transfer of funds Ms.
Elwood is a lot of talk.

1120
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:50,494
Mr. Fallon.

1121
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:52,812
My husband is not to blame.

1122
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:56,204
I transferred my account
because I wanted to.

1123
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,719
Sanford and the others will
be there at the opening.

1124
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:00,891
Better prepare yourself.

1125
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:04,294
If you have other suggestions,

1126
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,771
Call the working hours bank.

1127
01:25:07,617 --> 01:25:10,842
You promised my wife
not to interfere.

1128
01:25:13,177 --> 01:25:15,393
I also did, a promise
to your father.

1129
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:28,206
George...
Is there a danger?

1130
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:31,210
Certainly not.

1131
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:35,623
So, for having
transferred my account?

1132
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:40,120
Do you end up believing in Fallon?

1133
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,868
The withdrawals exceed deposits.
This is worrying!

1134
01:26:08,894 --> 01:26:11,245
I told you, it was okay!

1135
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,127
There's Mr. Galbreth!
George.

1136
01:26:16,107 --> 01:26:17,973
Lets sit.
Thank you.

1137
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:21,185
One afternoon loaded...
In fact.

1138
01:26:21,537 --> 01:26:25,488
The Banking division is worried
about the spread of these rumors.

1139
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:28,364
You will not believe...
We know it to be unfounded.

1140
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,209
Its stability is undeniable.

1141
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:33,198
But rumors may spread
to other banks.

1142
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:35,521
Yes, it is a possibility.

1143
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:37,589
We must stop it.
Immediately.

1144
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:41,958
We will send an inspector, who
will validate your accounts,

1145
01:26:42,088 --> 01:26:44,859
And issue a statement
reassuring the population.

1146
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,655
What suits you?

1147
01:26:49,156 --> 01:26:51,525
This is a great idea.
Perfect.

1148
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:53,523
See you then.

1149
01:26:56,289 --> 01:26:57,643
Good-bye, sir.

1150
01:27:10,863 --> 01:27:12,752
"President George
Elwood has disappeared.

1151
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:14,990
$ 200,000 dollars is missing. "

1152
01:27:15,016 --> 01:27:18,180
"The New Orleans loot
the bank in protest."

1153
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:22,490
"George Elwood, president of the
Gulf Bank City, was not found."

1154
01:27:24,288 --> 01:27:25,367
Good...

1155
01:27:25,951 --> 01:27:28,318
Looks like I waited a long time...
Yes.

1156
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:31,532
I'll stay in the lighthouse,
lose less easily.

1157
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,298
Sorry to keep you involved in this...

1158
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:35,888
What are you talking?

1159
01:27:35,914 --> 01:27:37,496
Everything was fine until yesterday.

1160
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:40,419
If that idiot had not
gone with the money...

1161
01:27:40,743 --> 01:27:42,630
Everything is going
well for me, Mark.

1162
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:45,166
I told you:
I and deposits...

1163
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:48,670
And after all, your work...

1164
01:27:48,837 --> 01:27:51,749
I would have liked to have had at least
one of those beautiful curtains.

1165
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:53,368
The view from the window...

1166
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:57,738
And this table will be famous...
You'll get there one day.

1167
01:28:02,007 --> 01:28:05,393
Let's get started right away!
Do you have any new cards?

1168
01:28:05,966 --> 01:28:09,195
Are you serious?
I have a dozen games.

1169
01:28:09,221 --> 01:28:11,128
And the Sultana hand
tonight, at 9 o'clock.

1170
01:28:11,154 --> 01:28:12,931
You know the weather!

1171
01:28:12,957 --> 01:28:15,657
These boats are homesick.
Me too!

1172
01:28:15,683 --> 01:28:17,966
I'll book the tickets.

1173
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,201
I'll see you later, Ann.

1174
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:23,450
I hate to give up.

1175
01:28:23,476 --> 01:28:26,913
You are the centerpiece
of our projects.

1176
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:29,977
I know.
But our destiny is like this.

1177
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:32,461
I'm grateful for what you've done.

1178
01:28:32,491 --> 01:28:35,329
I know I can not
demand anything more.

1179
01:28:35,355 --> 01:28:36,461
Aha...

1180
01:28:36,855 --> 01:28:39,490
Although this beautiful
place had seen the day,

1181
01:28:39,516 --> 01:28:41,098
He would not have chosen you.

1182
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:43,312
So...

1183
01:28:43,338 --> 01:28:45,889
Until I see you and
Polly, once in a while...

1184
01:28:46,469 --> 01:28:47,602
Aha...

1185
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:50,921
And I know it's okay for you...

1186
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,659
You are wonderful.

1187
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:15,982
Sign the deed of sale, Angelique.

1188
01:29:16,632 --> 01:29:18,896
The Larouchet are not
in a hurry to move.

1189
01:29:18,922 --> 01:29:21,147
They allow you to go
whenever you want.

1190
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,971
Next week.

1191
01:29:22,997 --> 01:29:25,750
I am very glad that
you get rid of there.

1192
01:29:25,776 --> 01:29:28,449
You close this unfortunate
chapter in your life.

1193
01:29:29,056 --> 01:29:31,070
Do you come home?

1194
01:29:33,681 --> 01:29:34,900
I do not know.

1195
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:37,783
You have not been returned
since your father died.

1196
01:29:38,097 --> 01:29:40,286
He wanted you to live there.

1197
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:43,521
Let me know, your decision. Yes.

1198
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:46,835
Thank you, Stanley.
Goodbye dear.

1199
01:30:02,841 --> 01:30:05,165
Captain.
Mr. Fallon.

1200
01:30:05,315 --> 01:30:08,561
Unsurprisingly, you're
back with us on the river.

1201
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:09,994
You can count on me.

1202
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,846
You make us the most
exciting trips.

1203
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:14,615
It's beneficial to me.

1204
01:30:25,116 --> 01:30:26,226
Good...

1205
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,077
So?
How's Leah?

1206
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:37,443
All right?
Yes!

1207
01:30:37,469 --> 01:30:39,582
And this time, you want to stop.

1208
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:41,964
The court ruled:
He is free.

1209
01:30:42,552 --> 01:30:45,625
You promised your father that
you always take care of her.

1210
01:30:46,346 --> 01:30:49,847
Go for it, Mark.
Try to see it.

1211
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:55,766
It is not...
It would not work...

1212
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:58,992
It's better that way.

1213
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:04,810
After all, no one
won, all your bets...

1214
01:32:26,914 --> 01:32:30,555
Will you admit that you
hide behind your brother?

1215
01:32:31,998 --> 01:32:34,960
You admire because you
are afraid to live.

1216
01:32:35,652 --> 01:32:38,324
Because your mother died
when you were born?

1217
01:32:39,362 --> 01:32:41,560
We are in love with one another.

1218
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,490
It's forever.

1219
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,887
I want you.
And I want your happiness.

1220
01:33:14,496 --> 01:33:16,315
Lift the bridge!

1221
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:27,624
But who will cast off!

1222
01:33:46,655 --> 01:33:48,155
Wherever you go...
